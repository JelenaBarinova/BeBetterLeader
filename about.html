<p>
I am development manager with technical background (mostly Microsoft technologies based), past four years working in product development. I am result-oriented and think that process is the way to reach the goal, therefore should not to be focused too much. That is why I am trying to combine known development frameworks and processes to achieve best results â€“ to deliver value to clients.

Lately mostly interested in agile management methodologies. Always follow servant-leadership management style, trying to keep healthy balance between freedom and order.
