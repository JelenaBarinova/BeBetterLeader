This is the continuation of my job search odyssey (first three months may be found <span style="color: #ff0000;">here</span>).

###### Month 4 (January): coding

Stopped applying desperately, in fact there are 5 at most companies that could provide H1B sponsorship. And those companies are the hardest to get into.

Spending a lot time on coding. Got one more quite successful screening..

Trying [hired.com](http://hired.com), created a profile there, successfully passed a coding test. My profile got approved! They claim they approve 10% of all applications - so this is quite an achievement. They event have scheduled to auction date for me. But guess what!? :) Right, visa stuff, again! They work only with candidates that are authorized for work or have a transferrable work visa.

So this is a list of tasks I have accomplished during January:

*   Got approved on hired.com
*   Found a [hacker rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
*   Attended meet-ups.

###### Month 5 (February): high season

This was the month that any job seeker would be dreaming to have.

So this is a list of events and tasks for February:

*   5 screenings with HR
*   5 tech screenings
*   1 whole day on-site interviewing
*   Canceled interview processes with 2 companies

###### Month 6 (March): the end of job search 'project'

So this is a list of events and tasks for March:

*   Accepted offer after one round of negotiations
*   Visa application process (I think I'll have a separate blog post on the visa peculiarities)
