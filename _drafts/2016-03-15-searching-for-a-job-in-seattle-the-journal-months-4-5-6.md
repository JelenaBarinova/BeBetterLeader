This is the continuation of my job search odyssey (first three months may be found <span style="color: #ff0000;">here</span>).

## Month 4 (January): coding

Stopped applying desperately, in fact there are around 10 at most companies that could provide H1B sponsorship. And those companies are the hardest to get into.

Spending a lot time on coding. Got one more quite successful screening..

Trying [hired.com](http://hired.com), created a profile there, successfully passed a coding test. My profile got approved! They claim they approve 10% of all applications - so this is quite an achievement. They event have scheduled to auction date for me. But guess what!? :) Right, visa stuff, again! They work only with candidates that are authorized for work or have a transferable work visa.

So this is a list of tasks I have accomplished during January:

*   Got approved on hired.com
*   Found a [hacker rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
*   Attended meet-ups.

## Month 5 (February): high season

This was the month that any job seeker would be dreaming to have. I've been really busy, having in average 4 calls a week (there were days I had even two of them a day) with different recruiters and hiring managers, I also had a full day on-site interview cycle, which was actually fun. 

Now I am a bit more relax, since I'm doing quite well with those screenings and I'm moving further through interview processes with several different companies. My confidence grows, so as happiness.

TA DA! Late February I got an offer! It's an awesome company and a job I could only dream of. 

This is a list of events and tasks for February:

*   5 screenings with HR
*   5 tech screenings
*   1 whole day on-site interviewing

## Month 6 (March): the end of job search 'project'

After getting an offer I went through brief negotiation round and accepted it. My "searching for a job" project is completed successfully and in time. I'm so excited and want to share these great news with the whole world, but I guess I need to suspend emotions here - it's just the very first step in a long "getting work visa" process.
After accepting the offer and signing the agreement I canceled my interview appointments with other companies and unsubscribed from LinkedIn's Job seeker's subscription. 

This is a list of events and tasks for March:

*   Accepted offer after one round of negotiations
*   Canceled interview processes with other 2 companies
*   Visa application process (I think I'll have a separate blog post on the visa peculiarities)
*   Unsubscribed from LinkedIn's Job seeker premium


## Epilogue

Entering the new era now - H1B application process. Will see what it brings me. But that's a totally new topic. Who knows maybe later I'll decide to write a diary entry about it as well.

I hope this was if not useful then at least interesting to read. I think I will definitely look into these posts if I need to prepare for a job search, though I hope I will not be in such situation again, I want to be head-hunted in the future, but not actively search for a job.
