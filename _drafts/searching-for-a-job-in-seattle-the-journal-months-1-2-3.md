So this is it - I've moved to Seattle, WA (my husband got an offer from Amazon and I decided to bring my career to next level and continue it in USA). With this I got a new challenge - find a job that I would love and be able to deliver value to people. I decided to think of it as a project with a very specific **goal**: to get employed; a huge number of **requirements**: job should be the one I would be happy at, would match my skills and experience, the employer should be willing to sponsor H1B for me, etc. I have **no hard deadline** though, at least for now, but I wish I finish this project successfully within 6 months (till April, 2015 - the date when employer needs to fill an application for H1B in order to start working from October, 2015). I've got lots of different tasks to complete and 3rd parties to coordinate and communicate.

So I've created a backlog with tasks to complete and major milestone to deliver (such as list of companies to apply, connections to establish, list of positions, CV, cover letters, etc.)![Screen Shot 2014-10-08 at 11.59.53](http://files.bebetterleader.com/media/Screen-Shot-2014-10-08-at-11.59.53.png)

Here I'll try to capture my journey to the goal of being hired by some awesome company.

###### Month 1 (October): slow-slow start

So this is October - the first month at a new work for my husband and the first time of being unemployed for me. I need to accept it.

I did very little for a job search this month because I had lots of thing to set up due to reallocation. Here is the list of tasks I have accomplished by now:

*   Updated LinkedIn account for Job seeker premium: 1 month free, 29.99$ monthly fee
*   Prepared "awesome job search" backlog
*   Made updates to my profile: changed location to Greater Seattle Area, updated the dates of my last employment.
*   Asked my colleagues for references and recommendations.
*   Asked my HR colleagues to share the best CVs they had ever received for an example.
*   Started updating my CV. Decided to do one (two at max) pager.
*   Got recommendations! Yey!!
*   Made a list of companies to check. Here it is: [companies to check](https://trello.com/c/Dzi6OHyy/4-list-companies).
*   Redesigned and rephrased my resume - check it out [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/p0ujtfhcr9wv7rd/Jelena%20Barinova%20Resume.pdf?dl=0).
*   Also after browsing nearly 30 LinkedIn profiles of people having similar positions I want to have, updated my LinkedIn profile.

###### Month 2 (November): sad but true

Finally I got several calls with recruiters from different rather small companies scheduled. Yey! Not a dream jobs seems to be, but will be a great practice before desirable interviews, I thought. But very quickly I realised, these "screening" calls will not help me "practice" interviews at all, because all of them ended after the very first question: "Are you authorised for work in US?". No. Thanks. Bye.

After constant work with LinkedIn profile, I got into top 2% profile views among all my connections.

So this is a list of tasks I have accomplished during November:

*   Got enrolled into Microsoft referral program.
*   Applied for 30 MS positions.
*   Attended 2 meet-ups, met many Agile enthusiasts, developers, Product Managers

###### Month 3 (December): i have a chance!

Made a mini research about ATS ([Applicant Tracking System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicant_tracking_system)) and got a critical look at my cv, analyzed tons of job ads and requirements. All findings from these activities resulted in changed resume. Here is the [new version](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ym2i547xbe9r5uj/Jelena%20Barinova%20Engineering%20Manager%20Resume.docx?dl=0), I'm happy with this one - it's confident, strict to the point and result oriented, at least I think so now :).

After heavily applying online to lots of companies with this new resume :) I finally got a response - meaning I passed through ATS! Huraayyy! Got 3 promising emails to schedule possible screenings. 2 of them somehow just stopped in the middle of arranging the date of a call. But one - ended-up in a screening call with a hiring manager.

Oh boy, how excited I was! I've did all the preparations I thought would be needed:

*   starting from reading everything about the company, news, CEO interviews, trends, teams, open positions, technologies, business, clients, etc,
*   taking a walk in the morning and bringing my self to the good, positive mood;
*   did some exercises right before the call to lift-up the energy.

The call went very well. I enjoyed it myself, we had a very interesting conversation, I was truly excited and like everything hiring manager told, asked, answered. I think he liked this call too, he even mentioned he wanted me for the interview on-site. Next day I got an email from the HR, unfortunately they needed to fill the position right now and could not wait for the visa process. I am getting used for this response. I need to somehow solve this challenge.

So this is a list of tasks I have accomplished during December:

*   0 value from Microsoft referral program, consultant "worked" with me for 3 weeks. To tell the truth I didn't get what exactly was his doing accept of sending me 2 template emails.
*   Attended Career Excellence seminar and a Career Mixer
*   Spend a lot of time on algorithms and data structures, as well as solving various coding challenges.
