<p style="text-align: justify;">We are planning another off-site day with my 
teams this Friday. We did similar one last year [Retro of last year and target 
grooming](http://www.bebetterleader.com/annual-result-review-and-targets-grooming/). 
This time it will be a bit different. The main idea is to change the place and 
think about work we do from different perspective - take a fresh look. I think 
it's good in both ways: as a teambuilding activity and as an effective 
brainstorming of the product team works on.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">[<img class="aligncenter size-full

<p style="text-align: justify;">There are two main targets this time. First - 
share the knowledge about the products each team works with and the second - 
make a short list of most important features (both technical and business) 
that teams plan to work on during next 4 months and of course share this as 
well. The plan is to conduct such kind of off-sites each 4 months and see how 
we do.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">I consider running this event with the 
following agenda:</p> 
<ol style="text-align: justify;" type="1"> 
<li value="1">Welcome talk - why are we here, what is the plan for the 
day?</li> 
<li>Product presentation (all teams together): 
<ol type="a"> 
<li value="1">From business perspective - will be done by each PO</li> 
1. From technical perspective - will be done by team representative 


</li> 
1. Grooming and planning next big features (in teams) 

1. Presentation of next features (all teams together) 

1. Closing 


<p style="text-align: justify;">As a side take-away of this day - I plan to 
take a video of all the presentations and share it within a company for others 
to get familiar with product my teams work on.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">Have you tried something similar? How did you 
do it? Do you have any suggestions for us?</p>
