We are planning another off-site day with my teams this Friday. We did similar one last year [Retro of last year and target grooming]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2013-03-17-annual-result-review-and-targets-grooming %}). This time it will be a bit different. The main idea is to change the place and think about work we do from different perspective - take a fresh look. I think it's good in both ways: as a teambuilding activity and as an effective brainstorming of the product team works on.

There are two main targets this time. First - share the knowledge about the products each team works with and the second - make a short list of most important features (both technical and business) that teams plan to work on during next 4 months and of course share this as well. The plan is to conduct such kind of off-sites each 4 months and see how we do.

I consider running this event with the following agenda:

1.  Welcome talk - why are we here, what is the plan for the day?
2.  Product presentation (all teams together):
    *  From business perspective - will be done by each PO
    *  From technical perspective - will be done by team representative
3.  Grooming and planning next big features (in teams)
4.  Presentation of next features (all teams together)
5.  Closing

As a side take-away of this day - I plan to take a video of all the presentations and share it within a company for others to get familiar with product my teams work on.

Have you tried something similar? How did you do it? Do you have any suggestions for us?
