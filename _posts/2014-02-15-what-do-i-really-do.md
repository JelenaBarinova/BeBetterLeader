<p style="text-align: justify;">I get this question quite often from people 
outside the company I work in. So I decided to gather main activities I 
perform as well as responsibilities I take at work into one short blog post. 
This is a kind of "[elevator 
pitch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch)" of what I do.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">Every day I focus on three areas: people, 
process and product. My main target is to make the most convenient environment 
for people to perform efficiently while creating the best product for 
client.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here is a short list of specific activities I 
perform in order to reach my target (categorized by main focus areas):</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">People</p> 
<ul style="text-align: justify;" type="disc"> 
1. Interview &amp; hire &amp; on-boarding 

1. Encourage people to take challenges 

1. Help teams to focus on company goals 


<p style="text-align: justify;">Product</p> 
<ul style="text-align: justify;" type="disc"> 
1. Drive tech excellence or refactoring projects 

1. Make sure that nonfunctional requirements of a product are not forgotten 

1. Drive GEO expansion projects 


<p style="text-align: justify;">Process</p> 
<ul style="text-align: justify;" type="disc"> 
1. Maximize convenience 

1. Steer the direction of process 

1. Maintain culture and environment 


<p style="text-align: justify;">What's your "elevator pitch"?</p>
