I get this question quite often from people outside the company I work in. So I decided to gather main activities I perform as well as responsibilities I take at work into one short blog post. This is a kind of "[elevator pitch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch)" of what I do.

Every day I focus on three areas: people, process and product. My main target is to make the most convenient environment for people to perform efficiently while creating the best product for client.

Here is a short list of specific activities I perform in order to reach my target (categorized by main focus areas):

People

*   Interview &amp; hire &amp; on-boarding
*   Encourage people to take challenges
*   Help teams to focus on company goals

Product

*   Drive tech excellence or refactoring projects
*   Make sure that nonfunctional requirements of a product are not forgotten
*   Drive GEO expansion projects

Process

*   Maximize convenience
*   Steer the direction of process
*   Maintain culture and environment

What's your "elevator pitch"?
