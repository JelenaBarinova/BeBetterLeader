<p style="text-align: justify;">[<img class="alignright size-full 
wp-image-112" alt="setup" src="assets/setup.jpg" width="250" height="288" 
/>](http://files.bebetterleader.com/media/setup.jpg)Recently I gave several 
lectures to students about Agile methodologies. I split the lecture in two 
parts: the first presentation and short questions &amp; answers session, the 
second -  workshop to try out Kanban in practice. In this post I'd like to 
share with you how I organized the workshop part.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">I chose Lego game for it to learn and 
experience Agile way of organizing work. I borrowed the idea and the setup of 
the game from two Agile enthusiasts Danilo Sato 
([http://www.dtsato.com/](http://www.dtsato.com/)) and Francisco Trindade 
([http://franktrindade.com/](http://franktrindade.com/)). I was short in time 
for the game so I changed instructions a bit and narrowed down the targets to 
two. The first - to feel the difference between pull and push scheduling 
approaches and the second - to learn how to deal with frequent requirements 
changes during the production phase.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">The rules were simple. We split to teams and 
each team was building Lego houses according to the instructions:</p> 
<ol style="text-align: justify;" type="1"> 
<li value="1">Take bricks from the WAREHOUSE</li> 
1. Bring bricks to the production desk 

1. Assemble the house 

1. Put the house to the MARKET 

1. Repeat 1-4 while the round is not over 

1. In the end of the round the Demand card is played (1 and 2 rounds) 


<p>We had three rounds during the game, 5 minutes each with 3 minutes for 
retrospectives after every round:</p> 
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-106" alt="warehouse" 
src="assets/warehouse.jpg" width="300" height="201" /></p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">1 round. **Warm-up**: do whatever you want to 
produce as many houses as possible. After the round Demand card is played. 
Customer purchases. Capture results. Do retrospective.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">Observations after the round: <em>Chaos. Loud 
conversations. Representatives from all teams grab as many bricks as they can 
carry. After calculation the balance between money spent on materials and 
income from sold houses, all teams end up with negative profit.</em></p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">2 round. **Visualize and limit work in 
progress**: introduce "swim lines" (e.g.. "Select color", "Pick bricks", 
"Assemble", "Put to MARKET"), think of a strategy what color houses to build 
not to end up in negative profit. After the round Demand card is played. 
Customer purchases. Capture results. Do retrospective.</p> 
<p><span style="text-align: justify;"> 

<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-107" alt="market" 
src="assets/market.jpg" width="300" height="207" /><span style="text-align: 
justify;">3 round. **Pull scheduling**<span style="text-align: justify;">: 
select product owner, who gets requirements and priorities, follow the 
priorities. After a couple of minutes requirements change. After the round 
customer buys according to new priorities. Customer purchases. Capture 
results. Do retrospective.Observations after the round: <em> More quiet in the 
room. Teams have planned before the round how  houses are they building this 
time.</em></p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">Observations after the round: <em>Some teams 
tried to do some actions in parallel: e.g. one takes bricks, while he brings 
it to the desk , another goes to take other portion of bricks. They did the 
same with house building process. There were teams that even ended up with 
positive profit.</em></p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">After all the rounds we calculated the profit 
of each team and discussed what strategies helped to get a profit.</p>
