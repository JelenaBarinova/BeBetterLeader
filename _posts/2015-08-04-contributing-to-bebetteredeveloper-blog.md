You probably have noticed, that a couple of my recent blog posts are a bit too technical to be published under BeBetterLeader name. Since some of my readers are leading or seeking to lead non-technical (not software development related) teams, I decided to move these posts under the [BeBetterDeveloper](http://bebetteredeveloper.com) name. I plan to continue writing more of them.

So if you are interested in JavaScript, React.js, Flux, AngularJS, Gulp, Mocha and other JavaScript frameworks, tools and libraries - check it out or maybe [follow it](http://bebetterdeveloper.com/feed.xml) :).

If you are not into programming, that's awesome - you are more than welcome here ;) I will definitely keep on posting my ideas in this blog.
