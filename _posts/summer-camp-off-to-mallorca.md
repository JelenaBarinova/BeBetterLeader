So as you all probably know from my previous posts ([Idea and reasoning](http://www.bebetterleader.com/summer-camp-idea-and-reasoning/) and [Setting the stage](http://www.bebetterleader.com/summer-camp-setting-the-stage/)) my team is going to Mallorca to work for 10 days.

We are leaving Today. Iâ€™ll keep writing a journal and share with you how it goes, but meanwhile you can follow me on [Instagram](http://instagram.com/jfiodorova) to see whole story in pictures :)
