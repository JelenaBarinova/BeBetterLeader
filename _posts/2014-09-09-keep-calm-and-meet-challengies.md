<p style="text-align: justify;">Recently I've been asked to share how do I 
manage incidents and solve problems with my teams. In this blog post you can 
find a short summary of how do I usually do it.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;"> First, there are 3 approaches I follow:</p> 

1. Every challenge, incident or problem you face - helps you grow, it's a 
level-up for you 

1.  Worrying never helps. Action does. 

1. You may choose one of two: either being a part of a problem, or a part of a 
solution. I choose - solution. 


<p style="text-align: justify;">So having this in mind all the time - helps to 
move on to mechanical part of problem solving very fast. In presentation I 
cover what steps do I usually take and what tools and techniques I use.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here are the slides:
