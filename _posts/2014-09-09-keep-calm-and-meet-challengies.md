Recently I've been asked to share how do I manage incidents and solve problems with my teams. In this blog post you can find a short summary of how do I usually do it.

Â First, there are 3 approaches I follow:

1.  Every challenge, incident or problem you face - helps you grow, it's a level-up for you
2.  Worrying never helps. Action does.
3.  You may choose one of two: either being a part of a problem, or a part of a solution. I choose - solution.

So having this in mind all the time - helps to move on to mechanical part of problem solving very fast. In presentation I cover what steps do I usually take and what tools and techniques I use.

Here are the slides:
