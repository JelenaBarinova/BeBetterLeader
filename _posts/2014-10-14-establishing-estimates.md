<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a short introduction to one of many 
techniques how to establish estimates (in my teams we make estimation of size, 
not the duration of the task) - White elephant.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">This technique is taken from [White elephant 
gift exchange](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_elephant_gift_exchange) 
party game. You can use "White elephant" within your team when you need to 
estimate upcoming work.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">Recently I had an initial estimation session 
with one team (they are in the beginning of Agile adoption). This was a team 
of  7 members and they had 39 items (of current and upcoming work) to 
estimate. 

We started with answering these two questions:</p> 

1. What is the purpose of estimation? 

1. What do we want to estimate: size, duration, complexity, velocity, etc. For 
us it is size we estimate. 


<div style="display: inline-block; width: 100%;"> 
<div style="background-color: #fff; display: inline-block; font-family: 
'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif; color: #a7a7a7; font-size: 11px; width: 
50%; max-width: 310px;"> 
<div style="overflow: hidden; position: relative; height: 0; padding: 
100.000000% 0 0 0; width: 100%;"><iframe style="display: inline-block; 
position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"

<div style="padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 10px; text-align:

<div style="display: inline-block; width: 50%;"> 
<p>Then we decided what measures did we want to use: T-shirt sizing (XS, S, M, 
L, XL).</p> 
<p>We used simple rules:</p> 

1. Talks one at a time 

<li>Everyone in round-robin manner: 

1.   Takes a card from pile (or already placed) 

1.   Reads the task loudly 

1.   Put into one column (XS, S, M, L, XL) if hard to decide – put into M 

1.   Explain why? 


</li> 
1. If task was moved 3 times – it cannot be moved again, meaning that we need 
to discuss more about it afterwards. 

1. Repeat while everyone agrees

height="306" />We've managed to finish estimating in less than half an 
hour.</p> 
<p>During this session we achieved:</p> 

1. Common understanding about all the tasks we have in scope 

1. Common feeling how to estimate relatively 

1. Visualization of how much loaded with work are our team members 

1. Information for further future when we will be figuring out what is our 
velocity 

1. The list of unclear/need to discuss tasks 


<p>Things  to keep in mind while estimating:</p> 

1. Compare stories to get estimates 

1. Use more than one example 

1. Group similar sized user stories
