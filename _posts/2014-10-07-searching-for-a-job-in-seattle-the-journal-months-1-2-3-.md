<p style="text-align: justify;">So this is it - I've moved to Seattle, WA (my 
husband got an offer from Amazon and I decided to bring my career to next 
level and continue it in USA). With this I got a new challenge - find a job 
that I would love and be able to deliver value to people. I decided to think 
of it as a project with a very specific **goal**: to get employed; a huge 
number of **requirements**: job should be the one I would be happy at, would 
match my skills and experience, the employer should be willing to sponsor H1B 
for me, etc. I have **no hard deadline** though, at least for now, but I wish 
I finish this project successfully within 6 months (till April, 2015 - the 
date when employer needs to fill an application for H1B in order to start 
working from October, 2015). I've got lots of different tasks to complete and 
3rd parties to coordinate and communicate.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">So I've created a backlog with tasks to 
complete and major milestone to deliver (such as list of companies to apply, 
connections to establish, list of positions, CV, cover letters, etc.)<img

<p style="text-align: justify;">Here I'll try to capture my journey to the 
goal of being hired by some awesome company.</p> 
<h6 style="text-align: justify;">Month 1 (October): slow-slow start</h6> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">So this is October - the first month at a new 
work for my husband and the first time of being unemployed for me. I need to 
accept it.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">I did very little for a job search this month 
because I had lots of thing to set up due to reallocation. Here is the list of 
tasks I have accomplished by now:</p> 
<ul style="text-align: justify;"> 
1. Updated LinkedIn account for Job seeker premium: 1 month free, 29.99$ 
monthly fee 

1. Prepared "awesome job search" backlog 

1. Made updates to my profile: changed location to Greater Seattle Area, 
updated the dates of my last employment. 

1. Asked my colleagues for references and recommendations. 

1. Asked my HR colleagues to share the best CVs they had ever received for an 
example. 

1. Started updating my CV. Decided to do one (two at max) pager. 

1. Got recommendations! Yey!! 

1. Made a list of companies to check. Here it is: [companies to 
check](https://trello.com/c/Dzi6OHyy/4-list-companies). 

1. Redesigned and rephrased my resume - check it out 
[here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/p0ujtfhcr9wv7rd/Jelena%20Barinova%20Resume.pdf?dl=0). 

1. Also after browsing nearly 30 LinkedIn profiles of people having similar 
positions I want to have, updated my LinkedIn profile. 


<h6 style="text-align: justify;">Month 2 (November): sad but true</h6> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally I got several calls with recruiters 
from different rather small companies scheduled. Yey! Not a dream jobs seems 
to be, but will be a great practice before desirable interviews, I thought. 
But very quickly I realised, these "screening" calls will not help me 
"practice" interviews at all, because all of them ended after the very first 
question: "Are you authorised for work in US?". No. Thanks. Bye.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">After constant work with LinkedIn profile, I 
got into top 2% profile views among all my connections.</p> 
<p>[<img class="aligncenter wp-image-666" src="assets/LinkedIn.png" 
alt="LinkedIn" width="582" height="187" 
/>](http://files.bebetterleader.com/media/LinkedIn.png)</p> 
<p>So this is a list of tasks I have accomplished during November:</p> 

1. Got enrolled into Microsoft referral program. 

1. Applied for 30 MS positions. 

1. Attended 2 meet-ups, met many Agile enthusiasts, developers, Product 
Managers 


<h6 style="text-align: justify;">Month 3 (December): i have a chance!</h6> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">Made a mini research about ATS ([Applicant 
Tracking System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicant_tracking_system)) and 
got a critical look at my cv, analyzed tons of job ads and requirements. All 
findings from these activities resulted in changed resume. Here is the [new 
version](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ym2i547xbe9r5uj/Jelena%20Barinova%20Engineering%20Manager%20Resume.docx?dl=0), 
I'm happy with this one - it's confident, strict to the point and result 
oriented, at least I think so now :).</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">After heavily applying online to lots of 
companies with this new resume :) I finally got a response - meaning I passed 
through ATS! Huraayyy! Got 3 promising emails to schedule possible screenings. 
2 of them somehow just stopped in the middle of arranging the date of a call. 
But one - ended-up in a screening call with a hiring manager.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">Oh boy, how excited I was! I've did all the 
preparations I thought would be needed:</p> 
<ul style="text-align: justify;"> 
<li style="text-align: justify;">starting from reading everything about the 
company, news, CEO interviews, trends, teams, open positions, technologies, 
business, clients, etc,</li> 
<li style="text-align: justify;">taking a walk in the morning and bringing my 
self to the good, positive mood;</li> 
<li style="text-align: justify;">did some exercises right before the call to 
lift-up the energy.</li> 

<p style="text-align: justify;">The call went very well. I enjoyed it myself, 
we had a very interesting conversation, I was truly excited and like 
everything hiring manager told, asked, answered. I think he liked this call 
too, he even mentioned he wanted me for the interview on-site. Next day I got 
an email from the HR, unfortunately they needed to fill the position right now 
and could not wait for the visa process. I am getting used for this response. 
I need to somehow solve this challenge.</p> 
<p>So this is a list of tasks I have accomplished during December:</p> 

1. 0 value from Microsoft referral program, consultant "worked" with me for 3 
weeks. To tell the truth I didn't get what exactly was his doing accept of 
sending me 2 template emails. 

1. Attended Career Excellence seminar and a Career Mixer 

1. Spend a lot of time on algorithms and data structures, as well as solving 
various coding challenges.
