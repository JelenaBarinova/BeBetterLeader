<p style="text-align: justify;">Recently I read Jurgen Appelo blog post <a href="http://www.noop.nl/2013/06/move-your-desk.html">Move your desk</a> and this is my reply to it :)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It's not enough to move your table. You need to start listening, start asking, observe what team is doing, how they do it, what emotions do they experience, how do they treat each other, what challenges are driving them, what makes them sad, etc. Moreover, you need to  do it in a delicate way, that nobody would feel being watched, do it naturally.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I moved my table a couple of years ago. I caught myself in the beginning that nothing changed. But actually there was no place for change, because as soon as I moved my table I've got headphones :). If you put your headphones on and dive deep into your notebook - from that moment you can be anywhere but in the room with a team.</p>
