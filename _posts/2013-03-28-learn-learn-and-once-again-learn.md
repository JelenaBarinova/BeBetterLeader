Very short message this time :) Just want to share with you - I've joined online course at CourseraÂ  [Inspiring Leadership through Emotional Intelligence](https://www.coursera.org/course/lead-ei) to improve my "soft" skills. Hope to learn lots of cool tricks.

Maybe someone has already listened to this course and could share insights?
