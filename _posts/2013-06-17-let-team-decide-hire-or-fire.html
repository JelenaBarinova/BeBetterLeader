<p lang="lt" style="text-align: justify;">In our company we have recommended questionnaire to gather feedback about new team member at the end of his/her probationary period. It's an usual form with very smart and useful questions such as</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How well does employee possess job-related knowledge and skills?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How well does he /she work as part of a team?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How well does the employee finish what he is committed to?</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">and so on. Overall it is only 10 such questions and you may answer either putting a number or adding a more comprehensive comment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Recently I have tried something different. Instead of sending this form and asking guys to fill in, I've sent a short email to team members with only 2 questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Do you want to continue working with John in one team? (Yes | No)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The response rate was exactly as I expected: 100% of team members answered my questions (with original questionnaire response rate is approximately 40% after the first call and 60% after the reminder). Another positive aspect of this is that the decision was made by team, not the manager. Manager in this case is only a facilitator.</p>
<p>One thing you need to be ready for - properly react to answers. If you ask straightforward question and get "No" - be ready to act straightforward as well: find another team for a guy or fire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you still have probationary periods? How do you handle them?</p>
