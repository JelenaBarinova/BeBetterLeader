Here is another interesting and worth spending time on book I've recently read - "A mind of its own" by Cordelia Fine.Â [![mind_of_its_own]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/post_img/mind_of_its_own.png)]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/post_img/mind_of_its_own.png)

My take-away out of it: our brain is "multi-dimensional" and knowing these "dimensions" could help you better understand why did you do or say something, or why did you wanted to say or do it, or why did you feel that particular way in various specific situations.

So here are these "dimensions":

1.  _Vain brain_ - we all have small positive illusions that make us feel special, disturbing the thought that in truths we are not of more significance in the universe.
2.  _Emotional brain_ - usually we have no particular information why we are feeling emotionally strived, feelings triggered by one event can be wrongly used while judging other matters.
3.  _Immoral brain_ - it just not serve our psychological need to feel that the life is fair and secure, it also assists in maintaining all-important sense of moral superiority.
4.  _Deluded brain_ - even people with healthy brain think irrationally and unscientifically in particular situations.
5.  _Pigheaded brain_ - we are tend to stick to our important beliefs even if they are not true anymore, we think we know it all.
6.  _Secretive brain_ - actually our unconscious is faster than we, smarter than we and more powerful than we, it may even control us.
7.  _Weak-willed brain_ - there are many reasons for will to fail us, that's why we need to develop good habits to enhance a willpower.
8.  _Bigoted brain_ - though one might come to treat others fairly and justly despite of any stereotypes in some situations, we still need to work hard on controlling unconscious effects of stereotyping.

The book is full of examples and results of different researches to support each of these 8 "brains".

I say it's a good read for everyone who spends at least a little time in self-analysis.
