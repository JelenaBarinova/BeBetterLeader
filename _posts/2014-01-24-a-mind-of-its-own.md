<p lang="en-US" style="text-align: justify;">Here is another interesting and 
worth spending time on book I've recently read - "A mind of its own" by 
Cordelia Fine.Â [<img class=" wp-image-440 alignright" alt="mind_of_its_own" 
src="assets/mind_of_its_own.png" width="200" height="305" 
/>](http://files.bebetterleader.com/media/mind_of_its_own.png)</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">My take-away out of it: our brain is 
"multi-dimensional" and knowing these "dimensions" could help you better 
understand why did you do or say something, or why did you wanted to say or do 
it, or why did you feel that particular way in various specific 
situations.</p> 
<p lang="en-US" style="text-align: justify;">So here are these 
"dimensions":</p> 
<ol style="text-align: justify;" type="1"> 
<li lang="en-US" value="1"><em>Vain brain</em> - we all have small positive 
illusions that make us feel special, disturbing the thought that in truths we 
are not of more significance in the universe.</li> 
<li lang="en-US"><em>Emotional brain</em> - usually we have no particular 
information why we are feeling emotionally strived, feelings triggered by one 
event can be wrongly used while judging other matters.</li> 
<li lang="en-US"><em>Immoral brain</em> - it just not serve our psychological 
need to feel that the life is fair and secure, it also assists in maintaining 
all-important sense of moral superiority.</li> 
<li lang="en-US"><em>Deluded brain</em> - even people with healthy brain think 
irrationally and unscientifically in particular situations.</li> 
<li lang="en-US"><em>Pigheaded brain</em> - we are tend to stick to our 
important beliefs even if they are not true anymore, we think we know it 
all.</li> 
<li lang="en-US"><em>Secretive brain</em> - actually our unconscious is faster 
than we, smarter than we and more powerful than we, it may even control 
us.</li> 
<li lang="en-US"><em>Weak-willed brain</em> - there are many reasons for will 
to fail us, that's why we need to develop good habits to enhance a 
willpower.</li> 
<li lang="en-US"><em>Bigoted brain</em> - though one might come to treat 
others fairly and justly despite of any stereotypes in some situations, we 
still need to work hard on controlling unconscious effects of 
stereotyping.</li> 

<p lang="en-US" style="text-align: justify;">The book is full of examples and 
results of different researches to support each of these 8 "brains".</p> 
<p lang="en-US" style="text-align: justify;">I say it's a good read for 
everyone who spends at least a little time in self-analysis.</p>
