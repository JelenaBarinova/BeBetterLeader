This is the time for me to conduct a mid-year evaluation with every colleague in my program - that are 12 one-on-one meetings. Inspired by the idea of [mobile meetings](http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/01/25/170264905/walk-while-you-talk-the-meeting-goes-mobile) and because it is hot and sunny outside :), I decided to move mid-year evaluations out of the office and meeting rooms.

We'll see how it goes, I hope the weather will be comfortable and the mood right. I promise to share the results in two weeks :).
