<p style="text-align: justify;">This is the time for me to conduct a mid-year 
evaluation with every colleague in my program - that are 12 one-on-one 
meetings. Inspired by the idea of [mobile 
meetings](http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/01/25/170264905/walk-while-you-talk-the-meeting-goes-mobile) 
and because it is hot and sunny outside :), I decided to move mid-year 
evaluations out of the office and meeting rooms.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">We'll see how it goes, I hope the weather will 
be comfortable and the mood right. I promise to share the results in two weeks 
:).</p>
