<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://files.bebetterleader.com/media/best-product.png"><img class="alignright wp-image-528 size-full" src="assets/best-product.png" alt="best product" width="281" height="230" /></a>If I were hiring a Product Owner I would ask her one question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How would you build Facebook if you were a Facebook (Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, LinkedIn, any other well-known product) Product Owner?</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And I think this is a very good theme for a whole interview, starting with an idea and then discussing all other important topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who is the main customer</li>
<li>What are the top features for the backlog</li>
<li>What team would be needed, what skills</li>
<li>What infrastructure will be needed for the product</li>
<li>How much investments do we need to start</li>
<li>What are possible monetization schemes</li>
<li>How fast may we expect profit</li>
<li>What loads may we expect</li>
<li>How will we grow this product</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I think these are all very important questions for Product Owner to answer, even for existing ones and existing products. I came up with this today while reading <a href="http://thenextweb.com/dd/2013/12/02/much-cost-build-worlds-hottest-startups/">http://thenextweb.com/dd/2013/12/02/much-cost-build-worlds-hottest-startups/</a>.</p>
