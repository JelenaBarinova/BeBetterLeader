<p style="text-align: justify;">I have organized annual team results overview 
and targets grooming differently this time. Inspired by Joakim's follow-up 
after [Running big retrospectives at 
Spotify](http://joakimsunden.com/2013/01/running-big-retrospectives-at-spotify/) 
I started preparing for retrospectives after 2012 for each of my teams. In my 
case retrospectives where big not in terms of attendees, but in terms of 
scope: we had to discuss team's results after a whole year and then to define 
a vision and targets for 2013.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">I think it's a must to start every new year 
with a plan what you want to achieve and have main directions you are going to 
focus on. It helps a lot when you are considering several options, in such 
case you should always stick to those that lead to yours targets.</p> 
<h6 style="text-align: justify;">Preparation</h6> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">I believe it's a good idea to change 
environment for team events from time to time, so I booked a cozy conference 
room with coffee breaks and lunch in a conference center (on different day for 
every team).  Then started creating an agenda for the day. I came up with such 
plan:</p> 
<ol style="text-align: justify;" type="1"> 
<li value="0">Opening</li> 
1. Retrospectives of 2012 

1. Overview of company targets for 2013 

1. Team's projection of company targets 

1. Team's product's roadmap overview 

1. Discuss and define technical roadmap 

1. Closing 


<p style="text-align: justify;">I highly recommend to read [Agile 
Retrospectives: Making good teams 
great](http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Retrospectives-Making-Teams-Great/dp/0977616649) 
book, it has lots of practical advices on how to conduct retrospectives. I 
took a couple of games/exercises from it to give some dynamics for the event, 
to fill-in short breaks and involve everyone.</p> 
<h6 style="text-align: justify;">Opening</h6> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">I started the event with a short welcoming 
story, answered the questions why we gathered here and what was our main goal 
and what was the agenda for this meeting. After that I asked guys to empty 
their minds by writing down things that they concerned about on the cards and 
put into pockets for tomorrow [[1]](#lit1). Then we agreed on ground rules for 
the day [[1]](#lit1):</p> 
<ol style="text-align: justify;" type="1"> 
<li value="1">Do not leave the room if you haven't said what you wanted 
to.</li> 
1. Stop the discussion if you are bored. 

1. No trolling (do not talk in sake of talking or even trying to offence 
others, do not continue the discussion that will not have the result). 


<h6 style="text-align: justify;">Retrospectives</h6> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">And we moved on to Retrospectives part. For 
this I prepared in advanced: made short presentation of team's journey through 
2012. Starting with our targets for the year, I've put a couple of events on a 
timeline and ended with overview of what was achieved [[2]](#lit2).</p> 
<p>[<img class="size-full wp-image-86 aligncenter" alt="DSP_Journey_2012" 
src="assets/DSP_Journey_2012.png" width="700" height="342" 
/>](http://files.bebetterleader.com/media/DSP_Journey_2012.png)</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the team we went through this 
presentation, stopping to shortly discuss each event and remembering what was 
happening else and how we felt about it. This is a very good exercise for the 
team to analyze situations they went through, their behavior and results they 
achieved.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">I've ended these retrospectives by gathering 
the feedback from the team by asking how do they felt while remembering last 
year. They could choose Sad, Mad, Glad or Afraid [[2]](#lit2). These are root 
emotions one can express his each and every feeling.</p> 
<h6 style="text-align: justify;">Grooming</h6> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">After the lunch we started Grooming part. In 
the beginning I brought back our development directions for this years. And we 
started discussing how those direction may be applied to our team. By the end 
of directions we were having a decent list (on the whiteboard) of things we 
can do to help our company to reach 2013 goals. Then we voted each having 2 
votes and summarized the results. That led us to prioritized list of technical 
features we need to implement - that was our technical roadmap.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then Product Owner presented product roadmap 
from business perspective. We discussed it a bit and tried to combine these 
two roadmaps into one team's roadmap - that actually was the ultimate goal of 
this event.</p> 
<h6 style="text-align: justify;">Closing</h6> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before making a summary of the day I ask 
everyone who attended to take 5 minutes and write down personal take-aways. 
Then everyone had a chance to share what he liked about the event, what are 
his take-aways and what to his opinion should had been done differently and 
why.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">And the final activity we had - gather 
feedback about the event. I've used Vacationer, Explorer, Shopper, Prisoner 
survey [[2]](#lit2) this time. The results were very good - there were two 
dominant responses: Shopper in the first place, and Explorer in the 
second.</p> 
<h6 style="text-align: justify;">Tracking</h6> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">I shared this idea of organizing annual 
overview offsite with my colleagues other program developers and they run 
similar events. After all teams had their targets grooming we gathered all 
together and representatives from each team shared what they are  going to 
achieve.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to that I've scheduled recurrent 
meeting every 3 months with teams to track how are we moving towards our 
goals.</p> 
<h6 style="text-align: justify;">Summary</h6> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">Overall I am happy with this event. Next time 
I'll try to involve more people in preparation phase and be more strict on 
side discussions that do not lead directly to the goal. And I am definitely 
having such a grooming in the beginning of the next year.</p>
