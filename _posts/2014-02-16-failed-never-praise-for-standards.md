<p style="text-align: justify;">It's very hard to share failures. Half a year 
has passed and I still feel some embracement and discomfort. But I want to 
make a note, especially for myself after some years to remember and not to 
repeat this.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">[<img class="alignleft  wp-image-456" 
alt="chocolates" src="assets/chocolates.jpg" width="205" height="205" 
/>](http://files.bebetterleader.com/media/chocolates.jpg)One evening I was 
just browsing our GIT repository. Looking through commits, wikis, etc. Pulled 
one solution, tried to build it - failed. Pulled the second one (other team's) 
- tried to build - failed again. And only the third one succeeded: I got all 
referred libraries downloaded, all need configurations done while building - 
no errors, very little warnings, everything built and ready to run. Taking 
into account a couple of failures that happened before - I was absolutely 
happy with the team, that they were keeping their solutions in good health. So 
I decided to praise this team. I got a big box of chocolates and went to 
stand-up meeting all happy next morning.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">Which was wrong. Never repeat it. No one in a 
team shared my happiness, they even were frustrated. 'Why do you complement 
this standard behavior? We get our salaries for that.'</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">With praising is pretty clear lesson: do not 
praise for standard behavior, praise for extra.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">But the open question remains: how to 
encourage teams to keep their solutions in good state if not praising for it? 
Punish? Promote standards harder? Educate? Push to clean-up?</p>
