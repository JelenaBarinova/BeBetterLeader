<div style="text-align: justify;"> 
<p>You've probably saw a series of [How do I 
hire](https://www.linkedin.com/channels/how_I_hire?trk=prod-inf-hih-0924-inpostpromo) posts 
by influencers in LinkedIn. Very interesting to read what do others value in 
candidates and what qualities they pay attention to.</p> 
<p>These I liked most:</p> 
<p>[If I'm the Smartest Person in the Room, We're in 
Trouble](https://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20130924104010-120446929-how-i-hire-if-i-m-the-smartest-person-in-the-room-we-re-in-trouble?trk=cha-feed-art-title-10000316) 
(<em>Michelle Rhee</em>)</p> 
<p>[Employ Someone You'd Want to Work For One 
Day](https://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20130924103240-8628736-how-i-hire-employ-someone-you-d-want-to-work-for-one-day?trk=cha-feed-art-title-10000316)  
(<em>Randi Zuckerberg</em>)</p> 
<p>[Come in and sit with my 
team](https://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20130924100831-32175171-how-i-hire-come-in-and-sit-with-my-team?trk=cha-feed-art-title-10000316) 
(<em>James Caan</em>)</p> 
<p>[The road trip 
test](https://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20130924100248-224083-how-i-hire-the-road-trip-test?trk=cha-feed-art-title-10000316) 
(<em>Shane Atchison</em>)</p> 
<p>The topic is very interesting for me, because I am involved in hiring a 
lot. This year I have hired 8 employees so far and there are 4 positions still 
open in my department. I would say that I do hiring all the time in background 
for atleast 2 years constantly. I though what would I answer if someone asked 
me "<em>How do you hire?</em>".</p> 
## Slowly 
<p>First thing that pops-out after hearing this question - slowly. I don't 
like making fast decisions in this field. It's very similar to [Trust your gut 
and take your 
time](https://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20130924094909-131079-how-i-hire-trust-your-gut-and-take-your-time?trk=cha-feed-art-title-10000316) 
(<em>Josh Bersin</em>).</p> 
## Yes from everyone 
<p>While hiring I have one rule - everyone who participates in interviews 
should say "yes". Usually we have 3-4 interviews for each candidate: initial 
screening with HR, talk with potential manager, technical interview with 
potential team and in some cases there are additional interviews with head of 
development or CTO.  So there are several people who have the feeling and 
opinion about a candidate. If there is at least one who has doubts or is not 
willing to hire - then my decision will be "No hire".</p> 
## Attitude over skills 
<p>And my current hiring motto is "attitude over skills" it's most common to 
[Focus on 
personality](https://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20130923230007-204068115-how-i-hire-focus-on-personality?trk=cha-feed-art-title-10000316) 
(<em>Richard Brandson</em>). Person with the right attitude, good motivation 
and energetic enough can learn everything needed.</p>
