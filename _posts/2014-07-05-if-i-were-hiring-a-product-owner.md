<p style="text-align: justify;">[<img class="alignright wp-image-528

height="230" />](http://files.bebetterleader.com/media/best-product.png)If I 
were hiring a Product Owner I would ask her one question:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">How would you build Facebook if you were a 
Facebook (Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, LinkedIn, any other well-known 
product) Product Owner?</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">And I think this is a very good theme for a 
whole interview, starting with an idea and then discussing all other important 
topics:</p> 

1. Who is the main customer 

1. What are the top features for the backlog 

1. What team would be needed, what skills 

1. What infrastructure will be needed for the product 

1. How much investments do we need to start 

1. What are possible monetization schemes 

1. How fast may we expect profit 

1. What loads may we expect 

1. How will we grow this product 


<p style="text-align: justify;">I think these are all very important questions 
for Product Owner to answer, even for existing ones and existing products. I 
came up with this today while reading
