If I were hiring a Product Owner I would ask her one question:

> How would you build Facebook if you were a Facebook (Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, LinkedIn, any other well-known product) Product Owner?

And I think this is a very good theme for a whole interview, starting with an idea and then discussing all other important topics:

*   Who is the main customer
*   What are the top features for the backlog
*   What team would be needed, what skills
*   What infrastructure will be needed for the product
*   How much investments do we need to start
*   What are possible monetization schemes
*   How fast may we expect profit
*   What loads may we expect
*   How will we grow this product

I think these are all very important questions for Product Owner to answer, even for existing ones and existing products. I came up with this today while reading [http://thenextweb.com/dd/2013/12/02/much-cost-build-worlds-hottest-startups/](http://thenextweb.com/dd/2013/12/02/much-cost-build-worlds-hottest-startups/).
