I am so excited because this October I am going to Stoos. I expect to learn a lot, meet awesome people and get inspired. I believe I can bring  bunch of new leadership ideas to try at work.

We’ll get together to share stories, discuss and learn from people who have turned their leadership and organizations around to match the needs of their workers, stakeholders and customers – and be ready to reach into the future.

Can't wait for it! :)
