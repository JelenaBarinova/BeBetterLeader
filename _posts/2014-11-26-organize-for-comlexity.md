<p style="text-align: justify;">[<img class="alignright wp-image-681

I have a time to put in a post all my thoughts after reading a new book - 
"Organize for complexity" by Niels Pflaeging.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is a must read for those, who feel that 
hierarchies, bonuses, command and control management - is not the right 
approach for modern organizations to follow and needs to be changed for better 
performance. You will enrich this list of "things to change" with even 
more principles and approaches after reading the book.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">This book covers many topics but not too 
deeply, that's why it leaves you with more questions than answers after 
reading it. It will definitely make you think, explore and seek for more 
information to do the change.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here are a couple of quotations, that I find 
interesting:</p> 

<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Self-organization is not the "right" 
term. Better would be: Socially dense market-organization.</em></li> 
<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Social pressure, used correctly: far more 
powerful that hierarchy, no damaging side-effects.</em></li> 
<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Your organization is already networked. 
It is just not allowed to officially operate as one.</em></li> 
<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Culture neither is a barrier to change, 
nor does it encourage change. It can provide hints to what an organization 
must learn.</em></li> 
<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Understood correctly, leadership in 
complexity means working the system, not the people.</em></li> 
<li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Let purpose drive behavior. Not numbers, 
or manipulative and controlling processes.</em></li> 

<p style="text-align: justify;">As I already mentioned, this book doesn't give 
you a deep and detailed explanation of topics, so I would highly recommend to 
listen to Niels presentation or webinar or attend a workshop. These together 
with the book will give you a much better ground for the change you want to 
implement.</p>
