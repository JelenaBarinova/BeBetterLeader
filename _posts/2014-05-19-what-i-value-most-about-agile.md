All of us have their favorites in everything: favorite song, favorite smart phone feature, favorite board game,Â  etc. What about Agile features? I've asked my fellow Scrum Masters one day what Agile things do you value most?

*Graph based on the answers from 12 Scrum Masters colleagues of mine

Actually these results correlates with my list of favorites a lot. Here it is:

1.  **Team focus on value delivery** - this is my top 1\. It's pure beauty for me when I see how developers care about customers, ask PO for problem customer want to solve, not the solution how it should be implemented.
2.  **Prioritization** - working on the most valuable things first - that's how we bring biggest value to client first.
3.  **Self-organization in team** - team decides how to do. It's based on trust a lot and involves making "_you are the best to solve it_" assumption. Once it is done, teams are open to become the owners of their decisions.
4.  **Deliver potentially shippable product each iteration** - constraints drive genius. That's why we automate our routines, create unit tests and make proper monitoring and triggering.
5.  **Transparency and visualization** - this helps you a lot in spotting weak points to improve.

What are yours top most valuable Agile things?
