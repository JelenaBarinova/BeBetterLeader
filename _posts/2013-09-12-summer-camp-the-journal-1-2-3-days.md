This is a journal of a summer camp I have with my team in Mallorca.

## Day 1 - Smooth | Long trip | No internet

Basically the second part of the day was fully dedicated for travel. We had quite a long flight from Kaunas to Palma - ~4hours. Everything went very well, all the team members were organized, no rush, no stress - very smooth trip.

First disappointment - as we came, there were no internet in the house, maybe due to the thunder and lightning, but the owner assured he would arrange fixing next day in the morning.

## Day 2 - Self-organized | Slow begging | Victory

This day was really strange, but in general better than expected. We had to get used to new environment, new people (wives and friends of team members), new rhythm. The internet worked from time to time, but everyone was calm and trying to adopt to given environment and conditions. Not much of working though. Product director gave informal lightning talk, followed by Q&amp;A session. So the theme for 10 days established.  After a short break we gather for planning, overviewed the work needs to be done, organized task board. Due to previous estimations this work should take 1 month. Everyone is engaged and believe that we can make most of it here. We'll see how it will go. This day ended with a good dinner at local restaurant and then perfect basketball game of Lithuanian team in Eurobasket. _Už Lietuvą, vyrai!_

## Day 3 - Work | Summer heat | BBQ

Beautiful morning. I like waking up early when others are still asleep, kind a magic time for me to make a breakfast while listening to nice music. Enjoyed morning sun and breakfast - perfect start for a new day. Today we worked hard all the day long starting from 9 am with stand-up and ending the work day with a successful release to production at 7 pm with a great "swimming break" at a local beach. Now getting ready for BBQ burgers in the yard.
