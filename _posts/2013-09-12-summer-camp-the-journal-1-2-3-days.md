a summer camp I have with my team in Mallorca. Please read previous posts for

## Day 1 - Smooth | Long trip | No internet 
<p>Basically the second part of the day was fully dedicated for travel. We had 
quite a long flight from Kaunas to Palma - ~4hours. Everything went very well, 
all the team members were organized, no rush, no stress - very smooth 
trip.</p> 
<p>First disappointment - as we came, there were no internet in the house, 
maybe due to the thunder and lightning, but the owner assured he would arrange 
fixing next day in the morning.</p> 
## Day 2 - Self-organized | Slow begging | Victory 
<p>This day was really strange, but in general better than expected. We had to 
get used to new environment, new people (wives and friends of team members), 
new rhythm. The internet worked from time to time, but everyone was calm and 
trying to adopt to given environment and conditions. Not much of working 
though. Product director gave informal lightning talk, followed by Q&amp;A 
session. So the theme for 10 days established.  After a short break we gather 
for planning, overviewed the work needs to be done, organized task board. Due 
to previous estimations this work should take 1 month. Everyone is engaged and 
believe that we can make most of it here. We'll see how it will go. This day 
ended with a good dinner at local restaurant and then perfect basketball game 
of Lithuanian team in Eurobasket. <em>Už Lietuvą, vyrai!</em></p> 
## Day 3 - Work | Summer heat | BBQ 
<p>Beautiful morning. I like waking up early when others are still asleep, 
kind a magic time for me to make a breakfast while listening to nice music. 
Enjoyed morning sun and breakfast - perfect start for a new day. Today we 
worked hard all the day long starting from 9 am with stand-up and ending the 
work day with a successful release to production at 7 pm with a great 
"swimming break" at a local beach. Now getting ready for BBQ burgers in the 
yard.</p>
