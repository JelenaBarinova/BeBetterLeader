Following the tradition, in this post I'm looking back to 2014 to summarize most significant things that happened to me during this year.

## Blog

I've managed to keep my blog alive! During 2014 I have written 25 blog posts (for 2013 it was 33), though I written less, visits increased almost twice - from 2500 (for 2013) to 4800 unique visits.

## Travel

This year was exceptional in terms of traveling for me. Not only I've visited 6 countries, was abroad for 54 days, but also I've moved to US in October.

## Presentations and trainings

In 2014 I started to give trainings and consulting for companies that want to adopt Agile. I've done 3 two-days Agile private trainings for companies and 5 lectures for students. Also made one new presentation on how to deal with challenges ([slides](https://speakerdeck.com/jelenafiodorova/keep-calm-and-meet-challenge)).

## Self-education and conferences

In 2014 I've completed coaching course, took a couple more courses at Coursera. Attended these workshops:

*   High Performance through Learning by Niels Pflaeging
*   Product management workshop by Bob Marshall
*   In October became Certified Scrum Professional.

## Career

It was rather a sad moment for me, in October I left Adform and followed my husband to US. He got a job at Amazon, so I decided to look for new career opportunities in Greater Seattle Area.

Lots of great moments I had in Adform, meaningful and happy time working with smart people, newest technologies, creating the best ad platform.

Miss my great D&D team. In a photo you can see the farewell gift my team made me :)



Thrilled and excited I'm looking forward for 2015 and all the challenges and opportunities it'll bring.
