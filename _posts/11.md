This is how my calendar looks like the week when I'm having meetings with each member of my team.

Usually I do 1:1 (one-on-ones) twice a year with each of my team members. So how do I do it? Differently each time. Couple of years ago I've been using "Moving motivators" as Jurgen Appelo suggests in his Management 3.0 course (please find instructions [here](http://www.management30.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/04-Moving-Motivators-A4-v2.00.pdf%20)). Last time I did [Walking and talking](http://www.bebetterleader.com/walking-meetings-are-just-great/ "Walking meetings are just great!") meetings.

![coffee](http://files.bebetterleader.com/media/coffee.jpg)This time we just took a coffee and went for a walk along the river. I prepare for each of these meetings: gather feedback (if needed), look through notes from previous talks, gather ideas what I want to pass and think about questions I want to get answers to. This time I asked these 5 questions:

1.  Are you happy here?
2.  What are you proud of from the last year?
3.  Are there any blockers on your way?
4.  How can I or a new Development manager help you?
5.  If you would consider leaving our company, for what would you do that?
