This is a journal of a summer camp I am having with my team in Mallorca.

###### Day 10 - Crepes | Work | Basketball

No trips were planned for Thursday. Whole day dedicated for work only. Today realized how it was really hard to concentrate on one feature at a time. You always depend on someone and someone depends on you. In our case I'm talking about other teams, they need to deliver something and they need you to deliver a part of it. Wouldn't it be cool to be able to do everything yourself, not depending on each other? The question is how to achieve this in a big organization (our is 250 employees big)?

Back to summer camp. So Today we worked all day long till the basketball game. Then all together cheered for our team. Watching basketball is a great teambuilding activity (of course everyone in a team should be a fan of the game, it's easy in Lithuania - everyone is a fan of basketball). Watching a game together makes you united and seeking for one shared goal, same as at work .

Today we worked for some hours in the morning and then went for vineyard tour and tasting. That was awesome, we visited one small vineyard and wine making facilities; listened to the stories of growing, harvesting and making wine; ate delicious Mallorcan food with several varieties of local wines. Very nice experience. I think everyone of us liked it.

After wine tasting we returned to work. Today is the last day for coding. Review and retro are planned for Tomorrow.

After the work - basketball again. Hope this game will be just as good as previous ones.

###### Day 12 - Review | Retro | It's over

> This too shall pass[![bye-bye mallorca](http://files.bebetterleader.com/media/bye-bye-mallorca.jpg)](http://files.bebetterleader.com/media/bye-bye-mallorca.jpg)

I love this proverb, it indicates that all negative as well as positive conditions are temporary. Our summer camp is over. We are packed and ready to return home. And here is a place for another great proverb

> The end of something is the beginning of something else

Though the summer camp is finished, we are coming back home and there definitely more to come for us.

Long story making short - I can say I liked this summer camp a lot. Though it was first try, I think it was best as it could be. There were good and bad things about it (I think I will gather all pros and cons in a separate blog post),  but one I can say for sure - all these days I felt comfortable around these people - and that's how it always should be in a team.
