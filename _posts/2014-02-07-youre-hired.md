So you've done a huge job - you've hired a person. What's next? And here comes a very important stage - onboarding. This is the time you teach and pass to the person culture, traditions, processes, everything. How do I do it? In 6 simple steps.

**1. Intro**. First I like to give an introduction to a new person same day he starts - usual stuff: org structure, who is who, how we are used to work, set some ground rules.

**2. Learn the product**. The main assignment for the first two weeks - to learn a product. We arrange extensive trainings for each product of ours for person to know very well what he will be building.

**3. Learn the client**. Trainings are followed by two weeks internship in client support, working as a client support specialist, getting to know the clients and how our product solves their problems and serves their needs.

**4. Learn the team**. From the very first day person starts working in a team, participating in stand-ups and other meetings team has. I think it is very important for a new team member to start taking tasks from team's task board (if there are any that fit him) or join a colleague for the pair programming as early as possible.

**5. Fast feedback**. You don't want to get a feedback too late. That's why I schedule recurrent meeting to sync with a new person every 2/3 weeks. This is the time I provide a feedback to a new team member (which I gather from the team in advance) and ask some questions to get to know are we on the right track here.

> How do you evaluate your start at the company?

> How do you like the product? Team? Code base? Process? Atmosphere?  Culture?

> How do you feel?

> Have you expectations been met?

> Would you like to change something? What? How? Why haven't you changed it already? What stops you?

**6. Probationary end.** This is the final stage of the "intensive care" period and here I let the team to decide whether to keep a person in the team or not. You can find more on how do i do it in my previous post [Let team decide: hire or fire]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2013-06-17-let-team-decide-hire-or-fire %}).
