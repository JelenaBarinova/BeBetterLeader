<p style="text-align: justify;">This is the continuation of my job search 
odyssey (first three months may be found <span style="color: 
#ff0000;">here).</p> 
<h6 style="text-align: justify;">Month 4 (January): coding</h6> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stopped applying desperately, in fact there 
are 5 at most companies that could provide H1B sponsorship. And those 
companies are the hardest to get into.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">Spending a lot time on coding. Got one more 
quite successful screening..</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">Trying [hired.com](http://hired.com), created 
a profile there, successfully passed a coding test. My profile got approved! 
They claim they approve 10% of all applications - so this is quite an 
achievement. They event have scheduled to auction date for me. But guess 
what!? :) Right, visa stuff, again! They work only with candidates that are 
authorized for work or have a transferrable work visa.</p> 
<p>So this is a list of tasks I have accomplished during January:</p> 

1. Got approved on hired.com 

1. Found a [hacker rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) 

1. Attended meet-ups. 


## Month 5 (February): high season 
<p>This was the month that any job seeker would be dreaming to have.</p> 
<p>So this is a list of events and tasks for February:</p> 

1. 5 screenings with HR 

1. 5 tech screenings 

1. 1 whole day on-site interviewing 

1. Canceled interview processes with 2 companies 


## Month 6 (March): the end of job search 'project' 
<p>dd</p> 
<p>So this is a list of events and tasks for March:</p> 

1. Accepted offer after one round of negotiations 

1. Visa application process (I think I'll have a separate blog post on the 
visa peculiarities)
