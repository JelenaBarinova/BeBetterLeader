<p style="text-align: justify;">This is how my calendar looks like the week when I'm having meetings with each member of my team.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-567" src="assets/performance-evaluations.png" alt="performance evaluations" width="506" height="215" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Usually I do 1:1 (one-on-ones) twice a year with each of my team members. So how do I do it? Differently each time. Couple of years ago I've been using "Moving motivators" as Jurgen Appelo suggests in his Management 3.0 course (please find instructions <a href="http://www.management30.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/04-Moving-Motivators-A4-v2.00.pdf%20">here</a>). Last time I did <a title="Walking meetings are just great!" href="http://www.bebetterleader.com/walking-meetings-are-just-great/">Walking and talking</a> meetings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignright wp-image-579" src="assets/coffee.jpg" alt="coffee" width="178" height="178" />This time we just took a coffee and went for a walk along the river. I prepare for each of these meetings: gather feedback (if needed), look through notes from previous talks, gather ideas what I want to pass and think about questions I want to get answers to. This time I asked these 5 questions:</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Are you happy here?</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">What are you proud of from the last year?</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Are there any blockers on your way?</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">How can I or a new Development manager help you?</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">If you would consider leaving our company, for what would you do that?</li>
</ol>
