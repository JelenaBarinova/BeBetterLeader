<p style="text-align: justify;">[<img class="alignright size-medium 
wp-image-10711" src="assets/quiet-196x300.jpeg" alt="quiet" width="196" 
height="300" />](http://files.bebetterleader.com/media/quiet.jpeg)Here is a 
brief take-aways after reading one more good book - [Quiet by Susan 
Cain](http://www.amazon.com/Quiet-power-introverts-world-talking-ebook/dp/B0074YVW1G/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;colid=35LOWQ4FF0B1T&amp;sr=&amp;qid=&amp;coliid=I2AOFX45GMPDML).</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">This book helps you to understand people 
better, to know how different they can be and what their behavior could mean, 
how to embrace your quietness and make it work for you.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here are some quotes I liked:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">We don’t need giant personalities to transform 
companies. We need leaders who build not their own egos but the institutions 
they run.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<blockquote><p>Open-plan offices have been found to reduce productivity and 
impair memory.</p></blockquote> 
<blockquote><p>Studies have shown that performance gets worse as group size 
increases: groups of nine generate fewer and poorer ideas compared to groups 
of six, which do worse than groups of four.</p></blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another study, of 38,000 knowledge workers 
across different sectors, found that the simple act of being interrupted is 
one of the biggest barriers to productivity. Even multitasking, that prized 
feat of modern-day office warriors, turns out to be a myth. Scientists now 
know that the brain is incapable of paying attention to two things at the same 
time. What looks like multitasking is really switching back and forth between 
multiple tasks, which reduces productivity and increases mistakes by up to 50 
percent.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">The “Bus to Abilene” anecdote reveals our 
tendency to follow those who initiate action— any action. We are similarly 
inclined to empower dynamic speakers.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">For all the managers, who does "people 
management" (I so don't like this phrase, but haven't found a better one), I 
would definitely recommend reading this book, or at least watch for this 20 
minutes [Susan Cain TED 
talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/susan_cain_the_power_of_introverts). The talk 
is not that good and detailed as the book, but still it gives you the main 
idea.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">P.S.: By the middle of the book I've started 
thinking that I am more introvert than extrovert, though always thought 
opposite :)</p>
