There are different theories on what's the optimal size for a team. In a first Scrum guide it was mentioned that development team should be __5-9__ [Scrum guide, February 2010](http://www.evolvebeyond.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Scrum-Guide-1.pdf). Amazon has [two pizza rule](http://www.fastcompany.com/50106/inside-mind-jeff-bezos), which is what? __4-7__ members or so. Jurgen Appelo suggests it's __5__ in a blog post [The Optimal Team Size is Five](http://noop.nl/2009/04/the-optimal-team-size-is-five.html).

I say it's - __3__!

This is why I think so:

1. Smaller team - less risk. I see it as an analogy to Continuous delivery and risk correlation. The less code you produce and more frequently you release - less risk of breaking something you have. 
2. The smaller the team - the more important each member is. When you are a member of a small team - you make much bigger impact in oppose to for example if you are one of 9 members in a team. 
3. Having a constrain of small teams - you will be forced to architecture your solution as decoupled as you can. Most of the time it's a good thing if you plan to grow and scale. Which is in synch with microservices concept, everyone is talking about now.  

Since [team is a group of people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team) and 1 is totally not a group and 2 is a couple :), then 3 - is a group and the smallest possible team.

There are some more nice to have features that come with teams of 3:

* When the team is 3 - it's easier to cover for each other. Most likely you will avoid ending up with the situation when only one team member knows particular part of the code, because of a huge scope your team owns.
* Conformance will be the highest in a team of 3. According to a social impact theory, [conformance is at it's peak when the team is 3-4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normative_social_influence). Meaning that attitudes, beliefs and behaviour will match easier in such team. And as you know: _Social pressure, used correctly: far more powerful that hierarchy, no damaging side-effects_ from [Organize for Complexity](http://www.organizeforcomplexity.com/). 
* When you are in a really small team - the feeling of being involved and making a change is strong and direct - your actions are more immediate. 
* 3 is an odd number, which is good when you need to vote for something in the team - you avoid ending-up in a dead heat.

I worked with different sized teams: from huge ones - ~15 people and to one person 'teams'. I liked teams of 3 the most.
To tell the truth, I prefer when teams form and evolve naturaly; but if I needed to create one - I'd go with 3 developers.

How big is your team? What's your optimal number?
