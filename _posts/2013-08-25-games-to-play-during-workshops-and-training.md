<p style="text-align: justify;">Here is the list of exercises and games you 
can try playing with a small group of people during workshops, training or 
team buildings.</p> 
## Games 
<p>These games take from 1 to 4 hours. All are good to learn different Agile 
methods in practice.</p> 

<li> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">Make teams. In a team: one designer, one 
messenger, others are artists. Designer sees the requirements - picture and 
explains to artists via messenger in written form, no verbal communication. 
Artists draw the picture according to description they got from messenger. Do 
a couple of messages. Do review. Do retro. Repeat with improvements. 

<em>Good for</em>: learn Agile, teamwork, communication, break the "rules"</p> 
</li> 
<li> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">Make teams. In a team: product owner, scrum 
master, others workers. Objective: create a travel agency brochure or a plain, 
or any other product. Work according Scrum, make at least 3 sprints, or play 
until the product is fully created. 

<em>Good for</em>: learn Scrum, teamwork, improvements</p> 
</li> 
<li> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">Make Lego houses using kanban in teams. Here 
are detailed 
[instructions](http://www.bebetterleader.com/lego-game-for-kanban-workshop/) 
how to run it. 

<em>Good for</em>: learn kanban, teamwork</p> 
</li> 

## Dynamic physical exercises 
<p>Very short up to 10 minutes. Very good between sessions, to stretch out bit 
and to move.</p> 

<li> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">Select 2 persons from a group and try to 
position yourself between them. 

<em>Good for</em>: dynamic, move</p> 
</li> 
<li> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">Select a person from the group and try to get 
behind him. 

<em>Good for</em>: dynamic, move, feel the constant change</p> 
</li> 

## Team building 
<p>Medium long exercises up to 1 hour, very good in teams for team building, 
knowing each other better.</p> 

<li> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">Every one stands in a circle. No one is 
allowed to talk more than saying a number. The objective: count from 1 up to 
15 (this number may differ according to participants). Each can say one number 
at a time. If sequence is broken - start all over again from 1. 

<em>Good for</em>: nonverbal communication, teamwork</p> 
</li> 
<li> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">On pieces of paper write each participants 
name (each name on different piece). Pass paper around. Everyone writes down 
what does he appreciate about person named on this piece of paper. 

<em>Good for</em>: feedback, team building, positive emotions</p> 
</li> 
<li> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">Describe the picture. Show a picture to one of 
the group. Invite another participant, the first guy has to tell what has he 
seen on a picture. Then first guys goes away, third comes. Second guy tells 
what he has heard. This way information is being passed through everyone in a 
group. Show picture to everyone at the end. It's cool to take a video, and 
then analyze it together and see what phrases make what changes. 

<em>Good for</em>: verbal communication, team building</p> 
</li> 
<li> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">Everyone writes down two things about himself: 
true and lie. One reads all things loud - everyone guesses who is this about. 

<em>Good for</em>: team building, knowing each other better</p> 
</li> 

<p style="text-align: justify;">Do you know any other games to play in a 
team?</p>
