Here is the list of exercises and games you can try playing with a small group of people during workshops, training or team buildings.

## Games

These games take from 1 to 4 hours. All are good to learn different Agile methods in practice.

1.  Make teams. In a team: one designer, one messenger, others are artists. Designer sees the requirements - picture and explains to artists via messenger in written form, no verbal communication. Artists draw the picture according to description they got from messenger. Do a couple of messages. Do review. Do retro. Repeat with improvements.
_Good for_: learn Agile, teamwork, communication, break the "rules"

2.  Make teams. In a team: product owner, scrum master, others workers. Objective: create a travel agency brochure or a plain, or any other product. Work according Scrum, make at least 3 sprints, or play until the product is fully created.
_Good for_: learn Scrum, teamwork, improvements

3.  Make Lego houses using kanban in teams. Here are detailed [instructions]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2013-03-24-lego-game-for-kanban-workshop %}) how to run it.
_Good for_: learn kanban, teamwork

## Dynamic physical exercises

Very short up to 10 minutes. Very good between sessions, to stretch out bit and to move.

1.  Select 2 persons from a group and try to position yourself between them.
_Good for_: dynamic, move

2.  Select a person from the group and try to get behind him.
_Good for_: dynamic, move, feel the constant change

## Team building

Medium long exercises up to 1 hour, very good in teams for team building, knowing each other better.

1.  Every one stands in a circle. No one is allowed to talk more than saying a number. The objective: count from 1 up to 15 (this number may differ according to participants). Each can say one number at a time. If sequence is broken - start all over again from 1.
_Good for_: nonverbal communication, teamwork

2.  On pieces of paper write each participants name (each name on different piece). Pass paper around. Everyone writes down what does he appreciate about person named on this piece of paper.
_Good for_: feedback, team building, positive emotions

3.  Describe the picture. Show a picture to one of the group. Invite another participant, the first guy has to tell what has he seen on a picture. Then first guys goes away, third comes. Second guy tells what he has heard. This way information is being passed through everyone in a group. Show picture to everyone at the end. It's cool to take a video, and then analyze it together and see what phrases make what changes.
_Good for_: verbal communication, team building

4.  Everyone writes down two things about himself: true and lie. One reads all things loud - everyone guesses who is this about.
_Good for_: team building, knowing each other better
