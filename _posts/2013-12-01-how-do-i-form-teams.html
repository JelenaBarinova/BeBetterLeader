<p style="text-align: justify;">Some time ago I read Crisp's blog post about <a href="http://blog.crisp.se/2013/11/08/mattiasskarin/function-team-vs-feature-team-a-definition?utm_source=feedly">teams</a> and decided to make a brief overview of team format approaches I take.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First I think you need to decide about who will be in the team and then decide what this team will be responsible for.</p>
<h6 style="text-align: justify;">Functional or cross-functional in terms of specialization</h6>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://files.bebetterleader.com/media/functional-vs-cross-functional.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-406" alt="functional vs cross-functional" src="assets/functional-vs-cross-functional.png" width="824" height="356" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are two ways how to decide who will the team consist of:</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" type="1">
<li value="1">Functional - when team is built around one specialization or function: for example team of testers, team of analysts, team of developers, team of devops, etc. Sometimes we call them departments. The main idea here - same specialization or function people are gathered in one team.</li>
<li>Cross-functional - when the team is built out of different specialization people. First what comes to mind: a team can be formed out of analyst, designer (such as UX designer), developer, tester. Usually scrum teams are being formed this way - we have different roles people in on team.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>I go for cross-functional teams</strong>, mostly because of these reasons:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;" type="disc">
<li>Such setup gives you faster delivery</li>
<li>Team has customer focus</li>
<li>There is a constant knowledge sharing happening between members with different experience</li>
</ul>
<h6 style="text-align: justify;"> Feature (product) or layer (component) in terms of scope</h6>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://files.bebetterleader.com/media/layer-vs-feature.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-407 aligncenter" alt="layer vs feature" src="assets/layer-vs-feature.png" width="794" height="311" /></a>I see two possible approaches to define the scope for the team:</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" type="1">
<li value="1">Layer team - this is most common approach and I think most of development companies start this way, when teams are being gathered around the layers of software architecture. For example: team responsible for data bases,  team responsible for backend, UI team.</li>
<li>Feature -  when the team is formed around a feature or a product and does a full stack development of that feature: starting form analysis, coding, testing, deployment, monitoring; and covering all the layers of this feature: data base, backend, UI, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>I seek for feature teams</strong>. Mainly because:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;" type="disc">
<li>It gives you increased value throughput</li>
<li>Team has an autonomy</li>
<li>There is a single point of contact for a feature (or product)</li>
</ul>
