<p style="text-align: justify;">This is the continuation of my job search odyssey (first three months may be found <span style="color: #ff0000;">here</span>).</p>
<h6 style="text-align: justify;">Month 4 (January): coding</h6>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stopped applying desperately, in fact there are 5 at most companies that could provide H1B sponsorship. And those companies are the hardest to get into.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Spending a lot time on coding. Got one more quite successful screening..</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Trying <a href="http://hired.com" target="_blank">hired.com</a>, created a profile there, successfully passed a coding test. My profile got approved! They claim they approve 10% of all applications - so this is quite an achievement. They event have scheduled to auction date for me. But guess what!? :) Right, visa stuff, again! They work only with candidates that are authorized for work or have a transferrable work visa.</p>
<p>So this is a list of tasks I have accomplished during January:</p>
<ul>
<li>Got approved on hired.com</li>
<li>Found a <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/" target="_blank">hacker rank</a></li>
<li>Attended meet-ups.</li>
</ul>
<h6>Month 5 (February): high season</h6>
<p>This was the month that any job seeker would be dreaming to have.</p>
<p>So this is a list of events and tasks for February:</p>
<ul>
<li>5 screenings with HR</li>
<li>5 tech screenings</li>
<li>1 whole day on-site interviewing</li>
<li>Canceled interview processes with 2 companies</li>
</ul>
<h6>Month 6 (March): the end of job search 'project'</h6>
<p>dd</p>
<p>So this is a list of events and tasks for March:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accepted offer after one round of negotiations</li>
<li>Visa application process (I think I'll have a separate blog post on the visa peculiarities)</li>
</ul>
