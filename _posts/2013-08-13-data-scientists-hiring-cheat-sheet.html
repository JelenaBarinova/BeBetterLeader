<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>I've been actively hiring people for 6 years now for different positions: developers, analysts, testers, managers.. My most recent experience - hiring Data scientists. Quite interesting new position we have opened in our company, so I had to create completely new questions for the interview.</p>
<p>Data scientists selection is over now and I want to share questions with you.</p>
<p>For inspiration I used "<a href="http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/66-job-interview-questions-for-data-scientists">66 job interview questions for data scientists</a>", so some of my questions came from this blog.</p>
<p>Here comes my data scientists hiring "cheat sheet":</p>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">What's the biggest data set that you processed?</li>
<li>What is data science in your opinion?</li>
<li>What output you usually produce in your researches?</li>
<li>Did any of your predictions came true?</li>
<li>What programming languages do you use? Why?</li>
<li>Which data scientists do you admire most? Which startups? Do you follow some blogs, conferences? Name a couple.</li>
<li>Would you handle click data in real time? In what context? Why?</li>
<li>Are you familiar with software development life cycle? Where does data science fit in it?</li>
</ol>
<p>The list is obviously not complete, and interview questions usually depend on overall conversation flow and every interview has it's own scenario.</p>
<p>What "data scientist" questions do you ask during the interview?</p>
