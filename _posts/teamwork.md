Today I gave a lecture at Kaunas University of Technology (tomorrow will do the same lecture at Vilnius). Want to share the topic and slides with you ;)

The topic is of a high interest to me - teamwork. In the presentation I try to compare different approaches of team formation, scope definition and some factors that influence teamwork.

Here are the slides:
