<div style="text-align: justify;"> 
<p>As every time something ends I do a retro of how it was, I decided to 
overview the year 2013. So here is a summary post of things I've done and 
results I've achieved during this year.</p> 
## Blog 
<p>I started this blog in march, 2013. Since then I've written 33 blog posts, 
that makes 3,3 blog posts per months in average. In total there were 2500 
unique visits.</p> 
<p style="text-align: center;">[<img class="aligncenter  wp-image-430" 
alt="2013stats" src="assets/2013stats.png" width="908" height="246" 
/>](http://files.bebetterleader.com/media/2013stats.png)</p> 
<p>Top 3 most popular posts:</p> 
<p>1. [Lego game for Kanban 
workshop](http://www.bebetterleader.com/lego-game-for-kanban-workshop/) (503 
pageviews)</p> 
<p>2. [Failed experiment: Self-designing 
teams](http://www.bebetterleader.com/failed-experiment-self-designing-teams/) (331 
pageviews)</p> 
<p>3. [Summer camp: results – 2x performance, but feels like on 
vacations](http://www.bebetterleader.com/summer-camp-results-2x-performance-but-feels-like-on-vacations/) (331 
pageviews)</p> 
## Travel 
<p>This year was quite busy in terms of traveling: I've been 51 days abroad 
(including both business and personal trips) visiting 6 different countries 
(and by visiting I mean at least walk around a town, drink coffee, enjoy some 
local food). For the first time I've visited USA west coast, this was awesome 
trip (and not only because I've got married in Las Vegas :))</p> 
## Presentations and workshops 
<p>For the first time I gave a talk to a big audience of approx. 100 attendees 
at Agile Day Lithuania on practical tips for better leadership 
([slides](https://speakerdeck.com/jelenafiodorova/73-tips-to-become-a-better-leader)). 
This was very interesting and challenging experience. This talk was followed 
by different lectures at Universities about Agile, Scrum, teamwork 
([slides](https://speakerdeck.com/jelenafiodorova/teamwork-agile-way)). In 
addition to that I also started giving 2 days agile trainings with workshops. 
I enjoy sharing my experience and knowledge a lot.</p> 
## Self-education and conferences 
<p>At the beginning of the year I attended English classes, later in spring 
took online courses on [Inspiring Leadership through Emotional 
Intelligence](https://www.coursera.org/course/lead-ei). Starting from autumn - 
I'm attending Coaching classes.</p> 
<p>Conferences and workshops I've attended this year:</p> 

1. Agile Day 

1. Agile Tour (conducted lean coffee discussion) 

1. Build Stuff (conducted open space event)

<p>Quite a year! Looking forward for 2014.</p>
