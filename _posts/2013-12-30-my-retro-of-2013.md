As every time something ends I do a retro of how it was, I decided to overview the year 2013\. So here is a summary post of things I've done and results I've achieved during this year.

## Blog

I started this blog in march, 2013\. Since then I've written 33 blog posts, that makes 3,3 blog posts per months in average. In total there were 2500 unique visits.

## Travel

This year was quite busy in terms of traveling: I've been 51 days abroad (including both business and personal trips) visiting 6 different countries (and by visiting I mean at least walk around a town, drink coffee, enjoy some local food). For the first time I've visited USA west coast, this was awesome trip (and not only because I've got married in Las Vegas :))

## Presentations and workshops

For the first time I gave a talk to a big audience of approx. 100 attendees at Agile Day Lithuania on practical tips for better leadership [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/jelenafiodorova/73-tips-to-become-a-better-leader). This was very interesting and challenging experience. This talk was followed by different lectures at Universities about Agile, Scrum, teamwork [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/jelenafiodorova/teamwork-agile-way). In addition to that I also started giving 2 days agile trainings with workshops. I enjoy sharing my experience and knowledge a lot.

## Self-education and conferences

At the beginning of the year I attended English classes, later in spring took online courses on [Inspiring Leadership through Emotional Intelligence](https://www.coursera.org/course/lead-ei). Starting from autumn - I'm attending Coaching classes.

Conferences and workshops I've attended this year:

1.  Agile Day
2.  Agile Tour (conducted lean coffee discussion)
3.  Build Stuff (conducted open space event)
4.  Change Clinic: Organize for Complexity by Niels Pflaeging
5.  Communication Excellence workshop by Travor Holmes

Quite a year! Looking forward for 2014.
