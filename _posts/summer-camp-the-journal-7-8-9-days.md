###### Day 7 - Back to work | Cactus garden | BBQ party

[![Task board](http://files.bebetterleader.com/media/Task-board.jpg)](http://files.bebetterleader.com/media/Task-board.jpg)Today realized that my shiny new HP Folio notebook has pour network adapter. Everyone around has got internet, meanwhile I have to use internet on a phone or share data roaming from my Nokia to pc. There was internet even on my Kindle, but not on my notebook. Angry. Work wise "ordinary" day - guys were coding quietly, our product owner  and me were having a couple of skype calls, wrote several emails.

During the lunch this time we had a swim in our pool, that was nice :) and very convenient for a short break. For dinner Today we had BBQ - beautiful.

###### Day 8 - Fixed internet | Delicious croissants | Calm evening

Well.. The morning started with fixing WIFI (needless to say that there were we, who just broke it before). So after spending 30 minutes on fixing we continued as always: standup, morning coffee this time with fresh made croissants from local bakery (mm…yummy) and work. Same as Yesterday: guys coding, discussing new features, me - skype calling, reading and writing emails. This time I even got to do a SQL task :) dropping schema and all related objects was awesome. Also Today it seemed not very realistic to complete all the task that left for us, but the team said - they would do it. We'll see.

###### Day 9 - Perfect breakfast | Work | Palma

It was very hot Today. We started the day with delicious croissants from local bakery (why they do not have such bakeries in Lithuania?). Then had deep dive into the work with some breaks for swimming in the pool. Internet frustrates us from time to time and really slows us down. Some assignments are simple not possible to accomplish without a connection, with slow connection they last for ages. The tasks are moving with the speed of turtles on a task board.

After the work Today we went to Palma to visit a city, castles, cathedrals, browse old streets. We had a great walking tour around Palma old town for a couple of hours. This warm beautiful evening was finished with a dinner at Hard Rock Café Mallorca. All happy and tired returned to our villa.
