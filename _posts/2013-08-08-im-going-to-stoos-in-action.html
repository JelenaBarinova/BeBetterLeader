I expect to learn a lot, meet awesome people and get inspired. I believe I can bring  bunch of new leadership ideas to try at work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We’ll get together to share stories, discuss and learn from<em> people who have turned their leadership and organizations around</em> to match the needs of their workers, stakeholders and customers – and be ready to reach into the future.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Can't wait for it! :)</p>
