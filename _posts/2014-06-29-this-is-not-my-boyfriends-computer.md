This week I gave an interview to KTU's representative. Interesting experience I would say. They were interested in my success as a woman in technology, because the university is working on attracting more girls to study informatics. Hope it will be published somewhere :) if so - i'll definitely sharing this.

And same day accidentally I found that Google was providing grant for women in technology to attend tech conferences (girls, who are interested go [here](http://www.google.com/edu/students/google-travel-and-conference-grants/#!europe) there are couple days left to apply).

Here is my essay, who knows, may be it will inspire someone..

## _My story and how am I going to make an impact_

_As a Program Development Manager in Adform I run a department of 28 software engineers. Out of 28 - there is only one woman software engineer in my department. And this makes me a bit sad. IT world would be much more diverse if there were more women in it._

_For a long time I was the only girl in a group of developers. I have changed companies, products, roles - but one thing remains - I was the only girl among lots of men. For most women it is a real challenge to join a work environment which is not “women friendly”. Working in IT for more than 10 years I got used to it. But it could be different._

_It's all about balance everywhere, in IT as well. We as men and women have different natural skills, combining those together give awesome results._

_I believe that most of the women just need a little encouragement in the very beginning of their carrier to make right decision. That's why I speak to students, write blog and try to show everyone how it is really possible to successfully work in IT and achieve self-realization in this field being a woman._

_In the next 12 months I will keep writing my blog highlighting woman’s position in technology more. Also while giving lectures at university I’ll encourage female students by telling my success story. I will keep supporting KTU’s initiative to inspire and attract more women to universities. And I will hire at least one more female software engineer into my team in a year._
