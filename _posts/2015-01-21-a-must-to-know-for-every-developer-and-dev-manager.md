<p style="text-align: justify;">[<img class="alignright size-full 
wp-image-10662" src="assets/Algorithms.png" alt="Algorithms" width="188" 
height="234" />](http://files.bebetterleader.com/media/Algorithms.png)If you 
are a developer and seeking to become better - learn and constantly refresh 
your knowledge of basic data structures and algorithms.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">A good motivational quote by Linus Torvalds 
(creator of Linux) why to learn basics:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">I will, in fact, claim that the difference 
between a bad programmer and a good one is whether he considers his code or 
his data structures more important. Bad programmers worry about the code. Good 
programmers worry about data structures and their relationships.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a great opportunity to take a free 
online class on this topic at Coursera. I've just finished these two: 
[Algorithms part I](https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI) and 
[Algorithms part II](https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partII). I can 
highly recommend these courses for all the developers and development 
managers.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here is the minimal set of data structures and 
algorithms every developer and dev manager must know:</p> 

1. Data Structures (linked lists, hash tables, arrays, trees, stacks, queues, 
graphs, heap) 

1. Big O notation, time and space complexity (very good cheatsheet for this: 
[http://bigocheatsheet.com/](http://bigocheatsheet.com/)) 

<li>Algorithms 

1. Sorting (insertion, merge, quick, radix, heap) 

1. Searching (linear search, binary search, depth first search, breadth first 
search, string manipulation) 

1. Iteration (various tree traversals, list traversal) 


</li> 

<p style="text-align: justify;">I know, that most of developers and dev 
managers are in continuous self-improvement process: learning new things, 
reading articles and listening to presentations, etc. You are doing a great 
job!</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">But for those, who feels a bit rusty - start 
today and these courses I've mentioned are the best way to do it.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">By the way, for those who want to exercise - 
check this great site with tons of coding 
challenges: [http://www.hackerrank.com](http://www.hackerrank.com).</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">P.S.: What do you think? What would you add to 
this list?</p>
