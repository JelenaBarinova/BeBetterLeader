<p>Very short message this time :) Just want to share with you - I've joined online course at CourseraÂ  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/lead-ei">Inspiring Leadership through Emotional Intelligence</a> to improve my "soft" skills. Hope to learn lots of cool tricks.</p>
<p>Maybe someone has already listened to this course and could share insights?</p>
