<p style="text-align: justify;">I was always curious what do people do all day 
long if they do not work!? For me it was frightening question. Since I can 
remember all my weekdays were preoccupied with important activities and rather 
strict schedule: first, school and after school lectures, then university and 
different kinds of part time jobs and later, professionally developing 
software for ten years.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">Pretty much all the weekdays were predefined 
for me: wakeup in the morning, travel to work, work, travel home, yoga class, 
two-three hours of a free personal time, go to sleep. Roughly rounding: 11 
hours work related activities and 5 hours of non work related activities and 8 
hours for sleep. So what do you do 16 hours a day if you don't work!!??</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">5 months ago I decided to leave my dream job 
and move to Seattle in search for even better one. So for 5 months I'm 
unemployed and have 16 hours of a personal time everyday in my possession. And 
believe me, from the day one of my unemployment I started getting this 
frightening "What do you do all day long" question very often.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">Recently I've read [interesting statistics 
on how do Americans spend their 
weekdays](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/01/06/upshot/how-nonemployed-americans-spend-their-weekdays-men-vs-women.html?_r=0&amp;abt=0002&amp;abg=0) and 
decided to share my daily routine.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here is how my weekday agenda looks like:</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">7:00 Wake up</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">7:30 - 8:30 Brisk walk (I escort my husband to 
his office and come back home)</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">8:30 - 12:00 **News &amp; job search**: 
catching-up with news and blogs on software development and management 
(mostly, via Feedly) or perform job search activities, such as: searching for 
new connections on LinkedIn, writing emails to recruiters, filling in job 
applications forms, etc.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">12:00 - 13:00 Workout in a gym &amp; short 
daily yoga class (while working out in a gym I try to listen to various 
podcasts)</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">13:00 - 13:30 Lunch</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">[<img class="alignright wp-image-10727 "

/>](http://files.bebetterleader.com/media/github.png)13:30 - 15:00 **Listening 
to lectures** (currently it's Princeton University Algorithms course provided 
by Coursera or MIT Open Courseware Computer Science lectures)</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">15:00 - 18:30 **Programming** (I decided to 
learn Ruby, so now I'm implementing various classic algorithms, data 
structures and solve interesting coding challenges using Ruby)</p> 
<h6 style="text-align: justify;"></h6> 
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignright wp-image-10699 
size-thumbnail" src="assets/lounge-150x150.jpg" alt="lounge" width="150" 
height="150" />I will not say, that all days are the same, the energy level is 
high and I wish to do all these activities instead of procrastinating on the 
internet or doing something else. <img class="alignleft wp-image-10700 
size-thumbnail" src="assets/starbucks-150x150.jpg" alt="starbucks" width="150" 
height="150" />But when these days come, I go out to work in some public 
place: either lounge areas in my building or some coffee shop in a 
neighborhood. This helps to overcome laziness and to stay focused on a 
task.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to this agenda, at least twice a 
month I attend different Agile | Project Management | Software Development 
Management and similar meet-ups and gatherings in Seattle. From time to time 
my agenda changes because of webinars I chose to listen online.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">I tried to achieve two main goals while 
planning my time:</p> 

<li style="text-align: justify;">Make the day as similar to ordinary work day 
as possible</li> 
<li style="text-align: justify;">Perform only professionally valid activities 
during daytime</li> 

<p style="text-align: justify;">With such agenda I feel that I do not waste my 
time and I am no longer afraid of the question "So what do you do all day long 
(if you are not working)?".</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although I am happy with my unemployment days, 
I'd rather found a job sooner to fill my 16 hours of personal time with actual 
work.</p>
