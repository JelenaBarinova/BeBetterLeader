<p style="text-align: justify;">So you've done a huge job - you've hired a person. What's next? And here comes a very important stage - onboarding. This is the time you teach and pass to the person culture, traditions, processes, everything. How do I do it? In 6 simple steps.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1. Intro</strong>. First I like to give an introduction to a new<a href="http://files.bebetterleader.com/media/hired.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-416 alignleft" alt="hired" src="assets/hired.png" width="309" height="219" /></a> person same day he starts - usual stuff: org structure, who is who, how we are used to work, set some ground rules.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. Learn the product</strong>. The main assignment for the first two weeks - to learn a product. We arrange extensive trainings for each product of ours for person to know very well what he will be building.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. <strong>Learn </strong>the client</strong>. Trainings are followed by two weeks internship in client support, working as a client support specialist, getting to know the clients and how our product solves their problems and serves their needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4. <strong>Learn </strong>the team</strong>. From the very first day person starts working in a team, participating in stand-ups and other meetings team has. I think it is very important for a new team member to start taking tasks from team's task board (if there are any that fit him) or join a colleague for the pair programming as early as possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5. Fast feedback</strong>. You don't want to get a feedback too late. That's why I schedule recurrent meeting to sync with a new person every 2/3 weeks. This is the time I provide a feedback to a new team member (which I gather from the team in advance) and ask some questions to get to know are we on the right track here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How do you evaluate your start at the company?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How do you like the product? Team? Code base? Process? Atmosphere?  Culture?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How do you feel?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Have you expectations been met?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Would you like to change something? What? How? Why haven't you changed it already? What stops you?</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>6. Probationary end. </strong>This is the final stage of the "intensive care" period and here I let the team to decide whether to keep a person in the team or not. You can find more on how do i do it in my previous post <a title="Let team decide: hire or fire" href="http://www.bebetterleader.com/let-team-decide-hire-or-fire/">Let team decide: hire or fire</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How would you like your first months in a company to be?  Or how do you do onboarding?</p>
