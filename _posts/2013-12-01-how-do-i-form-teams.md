Some time ago I read Crisp's blog post about [teams](http://blog.crisp.se/2013/11/08/mattiasskarin/function-team-vs-feature-team-a-definition?utm_source=feedly) and decided to make a brief overview of team format approaches I take.

First I think you need to decide about who will be in the team and then decide what this team will be responsible for.

## Functional or cross-functional in terms of specialization

There are two ways how to decide who will the team consist of:

1.  Functional - when team is built around one specialization or function: for example team of testers, team of analysts, team of developers, team of devops, etc. Sometimes we call them departments. The main idea here - same specialization or function people are gathered in one team.
2.  Cross-functional - when the team is built out of different specialization people. First what comes to mind: a team can be formed out of analyst, designer (such as UX designer), developer, tester. Usually scrum teams are being formed this way - we have different roles people in on team.

**I go for cross-functional teams**, mostly because of these reasons:

*   Such setup gives you faster delivery
*   Team has customer focus
*   There is a constant knowledge sharing happening between members with different experience

##  Feature (product) or layer (component) in terms of scope

I see two possible approaches to define the scope for the team:

1.  Layer team - this is most common approach and I think most of development companies start this way, when teams are being gathered around the layers of software architecture. For example: team responsible for data bases,  team responsible for backend, UI team.
2.  Feature -  when the team is formed around a feature or a product and does a full stack development of that feature: starting form analysis, coding, testing, deployment, monitoring; and covering all the layers of this feature: data base, backend, UI, etc.

**I seek for feature teams**, mainly because:

*   It gives you increased value throughput
*   Team has an autonomy
*   There is a single point of contact for a feature (or product)
