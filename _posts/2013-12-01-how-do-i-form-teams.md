<p style="text-align: justify;">Some time ago I read Crisp's blog post about 
[teams](http://blog.crisp.se/2013/11/08/mattiasskarin/function-team-vs-feature-team-a-definition?utm_source=feedly) 
and decided to make a brief overview of team format approaches I take.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">First I think you need to decide about who 
will be in the team and then decide what this team will be responsible 
for.</p> 
<h6 style="text-align: justify;">Functional or cross-functional in terms of 
specialization</h6> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">[<img class="alignright size-full

/>](http://files.bebetterleader.com/media/functional-vs-cross-functional.png)</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are two ways how to decide who will the 
team consist of:</p> 
<ol style="text-align: justify;" type="1"> 
<li value="1">Functional - when team is built around one specialization or 
function: for example team of testers, team of analysts, team of developers, 
team of devops, etc. Sometimes we call them departments. The main idea here - 
same specialization or function people are gathered in one team.</li> 
1. Cross-functional - when the team is built out of different specialization 
people. First what comes to mind: a team can be formed out of analyst, 
designer (such as UX designer), developer, tester. Usually scrum teams are 
being formed this way - we have different roles people in on team. 


<p style="text-align: justify;">**I go for cross-functional teams**, mostly 
because of these reasons:</p> 
<ul style="text-align: justify;" type="disc"> 
1. Such setup gives you faster delivery 

1. Team has customer focus 

1. There is a constant knowledge sharing happening between members with 
different experience 


<h6 style="text-align: justify;"> Feature (product) or layer (component) in 
terms of scope</h6> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">[<img class="size-full wp-image-407 
aligncenter" alt="layer vs feature" src="assets/layer-vs-feature.png" 
width="794" height="311" 
/>](http://files.bebetterleader.com/media/layer-vs-feature.png)I see two 
possible approaches to define the scope for the team:</p> 
<ol style="text-align: justify;" type="1"> 
<li value="1">Layer team - this is most common approach and I think most of 
development companies start this way, when teams are being gathered around the 
layers of software architecture. For example: team responsible for data 
bases,  team responsible for backend, UI team.</li> 
1. Feature -  when the team is formed around a feature or a product and does a 
full stack development of that feature: starting form analysis, coding, 
testing, deployment, monitoring; and covering all the layers of this feature: 
data base, backend, UI, etc. 


<p style="text-align: justify;">**I seek for feature teams**. Mainly 
because:</p> 
<ul style="text-align: justify;" type="disc"> 
1. It gives you increased value throughput 

1. Team has an autonomy 

1. There is a single point of contact for a feature (or product)
