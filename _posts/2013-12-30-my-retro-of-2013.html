<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>As every time something ends I do a retro of how it was, I decided to overview the year 2013. So here is a summary post of things I've done and results I've achieved during this year.</p>
<h6>Blog</h6>
<p>I started this blog in march, 2013. Since then I've written 33 blog posts, that makes 3,3 blog posts per months in average. In total there were 2500 unique visits.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://files.bebetterleader.com/media/2013stats.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-430" alt="2013stats" src="assets/2013stats.png" width="908" height="246" /></a></p>

<h6>Travel</h6>
<p>This year was quite busy in terms of traveling: I've been 51 days abroad (including both business and personal trips) visiting 6 different countries (and by visiting I mean at least walk around a town, drink coffee, enjoy some local food). For the first time I've visited USA west coast, this was awesome trip (and not only because I've got married in Las Vegas :))</p>
<h6>Presentations and workshops</h6>
<p>For the first time I gave a talk to a big audience of approx. 100 attendees at Agile Day Lithuania on practical tips for better leadership (<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jelenafiodorova/73-tips-to-become-a-better-leader">slides</a>). This was very interesting and challenging experience. This talk was followed by different lectures at Universities about Agile, Scrum, teamwork (<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jelenafiodorova/teamwork-agile-way">slides</a>). In addition to that I also started giving 2 days agile trainings with workshops. I enjoy sharing my experience and knowledge a lot.</p>
<h6>Self-education and conferences</h6>
<p>At the beginning of the year I attended English classes, later in spring took online courses on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/lead-ei">Inspiring Leadership through Emotional Intelligence</a>. Starting from autumn - I'm attending Coaching classes.</p>
<p>Conferences and workshops I've attended this year:</p>

<li>Agile Day</li>
<li>Agile Tour (conducted lean coffee discussion)</li>
<li>Build Stuff (conducted open space event)</li>
