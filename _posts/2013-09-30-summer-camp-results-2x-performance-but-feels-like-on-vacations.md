Coding on a train to airport[/caption]</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">You've probably followed my journal about 
summer camp (if not - [here it 
is](http://www.bebetterleader.com/summer-camp-idea-and-reasoning/)) and 
noticed that there were not much about work, but more about fun. That was the 
idea of a journal - to find something special in every day. I bet it wouldn't 
had so many visitors if I were pointing out only work part. Imagine how it 
would look like: day 1 - we were coding, day 2- still we were coding, day 3 - 
we were coding again and so on. Not so engaging as croissants, wine tasting 
tour or basketball championship (by the way - hurray!! We won silver!).</p>

an airport[/caption]</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">So this post is mostly about what left behind 
my journal.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the last day of summer camp we made a 
review and retrospectives of what we've done during these sunny days. It was a 
nice thing to find out that during those 8 working days **we've manage to 
accomplish twice as much work as we usually do in Vilnius** in 8 days.  But 
this was not a surprise, because guys were coding all the time except those 
moments that were described in journal. Literally, they were coding in a train 
to airport, in airport, on a plane, during basketball match, after the dinner 
and so on. But not only this made our performance better I think. There are a 
couple of possible reasons.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">You'll get more done, one task at a time, than 
you could have even imagined when you were "multitasking"</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">It's a quote from Jason Fitzpatrick blog post: 
["A Case for Singletasking: The One-Task-At-a-Time 
Method"](http://lifehacker.com/5646560/the-one-task-at-a-time-method-increased-efficiency-in-a-multitasking-world). 
Exactly the same focus we reached off-site: we had no meetings, minimum 
interactions with other teams and colleagues, no switching between projects. 
For 5 days (out of 8 working days) we were concentrated on one feature only. 
This I think influenced  our performance a lot.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p style="text-align: justify;"> I firmly believe that people should strive to 
integrate work and life</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">A quote by Jurgen Appelo from a blog post: 
["Work-Life Integration and Work-Play 
Balance](http://www.noop.nl/2013/09/work-life-integration.html)", where he 
writes about taking next step out of work-life balance to work-life 
integration. Working and living in a villa all together was I think the best 
work-life integration possible. Our lifestyle there was similar to 
freelancers. And with freelancers I thinks it's the matter of motivation: if 
you are interested (this was true in our case) - you work all your possible 
time.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Most were interested how would it go with 
spouses around, would we be able to concentrate for work enough. I think we 
got lucky with our spouses :) - we were working all together but each his/her 
own job: one was writing her master thesis, one was busy with a child, others 
were just doing their everyday jobs remotely.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Now I can say this was a successful 
experiment. We did twice more work as usual, people are happy, we enjoyed sun, 
we visited beautiful places - what not to like about it? Moreover, we became 
more connected as a team, now we have our own stories we share. Though it took 
lots of energy and money to organize, I am sure - I'll try it once again: 
maybe next year, same team, different scenery, better internet connection.</p>
