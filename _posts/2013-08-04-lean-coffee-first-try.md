today - <em>"Lean coffee"</em>. My college and I decided to organize it in our 
company. <em>"Lean coffee"</em> is yet another easy way how to run a 
discussion in organized pattern. To learn more about it you can watch a 
short [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhG-A-kRPAU).</p> 
<p>So we had our first <em>"Lean coffee"</em>, here are some insights after 
it.</p> 
<p>It was open for everyone in our development department. We had no topics 
restrictions, any questions and ideas were welcome to discuss for the first 
try. There were 8 attendees with different backgrounds: product owners, 
developers, managers, testers, scrum masters.</p> 
<p>We started by defining ground rules:</p> 
<blockquote><p>If you are here - then take a part in discussion, be active</p> 
<p>If you are bored - better leave</p></blockquote> 
<p>We followed such structure:</p> 
<ol type="1"> 
<li value="1">3 column kanban board: <em>Ready</em>, <em>Doing</em>, 
<em>Done</em></li> 
1. All participants put their ideas and questions to discuss in <em>Ready</em> 
column.  Everyone shortly introduces his idea. 

1. Each attendee has two votes and may give them to any idea. Sort all ideas 
by ratings. 

1. Take top rated idea from <em>Ready</em>, put it in <em>Doing</em> column 
and start discussing it for 5 minutes. 

1. After 5 minutes everyone votes: to continue (thumbs-up, another 5 minutes 
for the same idea) or not (thumbs-down, put it in <em>Done</em> column and 
take next). 

1. Repeat with all ideas in <em>Ready</em> column. 

1. Before leaving everyone shares their take-aways. 


<p>I would call it a successful experiment: we had well organized, very 
dynamic, not boring, "everyone involved in" discussion. We are doing it again 
in two weeks.</p> 
<p>Have you ever tried<em> "Lean coffee"</em>? What's your experience?</p>
