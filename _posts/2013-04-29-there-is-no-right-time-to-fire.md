I think for manager first lay-off is like a first accident for surgeon. It's just have to happen someday if you are being a leader (or a surgeon) for a quite long time. There is no right time, place or situation to bring this bad news for an employee, so the only thing you can do is to make it a bit less stressful for him as well as for yourself.

There is a couple of tips I followed while informing an employee that we are terminating the agreement with:

1.  Calm down and say it. The hardest part is behind - you already have made the decision.
2.  Be straight forward. It's painful, but leaves no chance for misunderstanding.
3.  Be short. People tend to say lots of useless words and phrases while they are in uncomfortable situation in order to fill in awkward silence.
4.  You don't need to excuse for you decision. You can tell the reasoning, but you do not need to feel guilty.
5.  Show that the decision is final and there is no place for negotiation.
