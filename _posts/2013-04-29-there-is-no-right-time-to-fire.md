<p style="text-align: justify;">I think for manager first lay-off is like a 
first accident for surgeon. It's just have to happen someday if you are being 
a leader (or a surgeon) for a quite long time. There is no right time, place 
or situation to bring this bad news for an employee, so the only thing you can 
do is to make it a bit less stressful for him as well as for yourself.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a couple of tips I followed while 
informing an employee that we are terminating the agreement with:</p> 
<ol type="1"> 
<li style="text-align: justify;" value="1">Calm down and say it. The hardest 
part is behind - you already have made the decision.</li> 
<li style="text-align: justify;">Be straight forward. It's painful, but leaves 
no chance for misunderstanding.</li> 
<li style="text-align: justify;">Be short. People tend to say lots of useless 
words and phrases while they are in uncomfortable situation in order to fill 
in awkward silence.</li> 
<li style="text-align: justify;">You don't need to excuse for you decision. 
You can tell the reasoning, but you do not need to feel guilty.</li> 
<li style="text-align: justify;">Show that the decision is final and there is 
no place for negotiation.</li>
