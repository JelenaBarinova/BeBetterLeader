<p style="text-align: justify;">As you probably have guessed already this blog 
post is about communication and ideal way of it. I think all companies that 
are growing fast (my company is exactly this type: roughly +1 new person per 
day) are facing communication issues.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">We exchange a lot of various information 
within a company: new feature releases, source code, KPIs, financial data, fun 
stuff - to name a few. And we use very different tools to share it: emails, 
SharePoint, GitLab, Excel, meetings, Skype - and the list is not complete. So 
the question is how not to get lost in <em>communication</em>. How to get the 
information you need at a right time.</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have some ground rules or basic approaches 
here:</p> 
<ol style="text-align: justify;"> 
1. The one who needs information should initiate communication. Don't sit and 
wine that you don't get anything - go and take it or ask for it. 

1. Don't try to unify communication tools, don't try to put everything in one 
tool. Tools are made different, each serves a particular purpose (a couple of 
examples: email - to inform individuals about something not so urgent, 
meetings - to brainstorm or to learn and share know-how in a group, calls - in 
case of fires, wiki or blogs - to share more structural and detailed 
information and insights to last long). 

1. Make it natural as it is in real on-line life. 


<p style="text-align: justify;">If first two are quite obvious and are less 
questionable, the third one needs some explanation. It is simple in my world - 
there are two sides in communication: those who send and those who receive - 
and the relation is many-to-many between these sides. Those who have 
information are responsible of sharing it: post it, tweet it and if needed 
promote it. Those who want to get information are responsible of getting it: 
follow or subscribe to it. Recently we started using [wordpress 
](http://www.wordpress.com)for sharing within our department. And the only 
unanswered question - how to implement following or subscribing part? Are 
there any [feedly ](http://www.feedly.com)like tools to use within 
company?</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">How do you share information?</p>
