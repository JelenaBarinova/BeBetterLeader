<p style="text-align: justify;">All of us have their favorites in everything: favorite song, favorite smart phone feature, favorite board game,Â  etc. What about Agile features? I've asked my fellow Scrum Masters one day what Agile things do you value most?</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_484" align="aligncenter" width="592"]<a href="http://files.bebetterleader.com/media/top-agile-things.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-484" title="Top Agile things" alt="top agile things" src="assets/top-agile-things.png" width="592" height="378" /></a> *Graph based on the answers from 12 Scrum Masters colleagues of mine[/caption]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Actually these results correlates with my list of favorites a lot. Here it is:</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" type="1">
<li value="1"><strong>Team focus on value delivery</strong> - this is my top 1. It's pure beauty for me when I see how developers care about customers, ask PO for problem customer want to solve, not the solution how it should be implemented.</li>
<li><strong>Prioritization</strong> - working on the most valuable things first - that's how we bring biggest value to client first.</li>
<li><strong>Self-organization in team</strong> - team decides how to do. It's based on trust a lot and involves making "<em>you are the best to solve it</em>" assumption. Once it is done, teams are open to become the owners of their decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Deliver potentially shippable product each iteration</strong> - constraints drive genius. That's why we automate our routines, create unit tests and make proper monitoring and triggering.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency and visualization</strong> - this helps you a lot in spotting weak points to improve.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What are yours top most valuable Agile things?</p>
