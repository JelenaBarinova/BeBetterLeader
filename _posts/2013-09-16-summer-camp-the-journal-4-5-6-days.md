## Day 4 - Work | 3 got flu | Celebration

So the 4th day passed. Full of work, swimming in the sea instead of a lunch, watching basketball game in the middle of the day and then working till 8 o'clock. Completely different schedule compared to ordinary day in the office. I like it a lot. Guys don't express their emotions much, but I think they like it here as well. A bit sad thing is that 3 of 6 team members got some kind of flu, so they could not enjoy the summer here 100%, I mean swimming and stuff. After a work we went in a restaurant in Sa Rapita (the small town nearby) to celebrate developer's day.

## Day 5 - Caves | Lighthouse | Late talks by the pool

Saturday! This day was dedicated for sightseeing only. We've traveled Southeast to visit caves del Drac first, and then headed to North to drive some serpentines and walk on the edge of rocky mountains in Cap de Formentor. On our way home we stopped for an hour in Alcudia for late lunch or early dinner - delicious food, good mood. Not much of a work, but lots of teambuilding.

## Day 6 - Morning coffee in Soller | Beautiful views | Even more serpentines

Another day off. From the early morning (9 am) we took off for more sightseeing. Starting with a beautiful small old town - Soller. We spent there an hour browsing narrow streets of old town, then had a coffee with croissants from the local bakery and headed toÂ  Sa Calobra very nice beach. After 35 km of serpentines we finally reached it. It was beautiful beach, paradise really worth going that way. We had to return till 6 pm - another basketball game by Lithuanian team, another one we won. Happy with lots of impressions form Today's sightseeing, with positive emotions from good game by Lithuanians, but a bit tired we chatted for a couple of hours by the pool and got to sleep happily exhausted.
