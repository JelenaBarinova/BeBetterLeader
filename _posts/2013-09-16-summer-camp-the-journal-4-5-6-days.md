<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a journal of a summer camp I have with 
my team in Mallorca. Please read previous posts if you just joined this blog:

<h6 style="text-align: justify;">Day 4 - Work | 3 got flu | Celebration</h6> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">So the 4th day passed. Full of work, swimming 
in the sea instead of a lunch, watching basketball game in the middle of the 
day and then working till 8 o'clock. Completely different schedule compared to 
ordinary day in the office. I like it a lot. Guys don't express their emotions 
much, but I think they like it here as well. A bit sad thing is that 3 of 6 
team members got some kind of flu, so they could not enjoy the summer here 
100%, I mean swimming and stuff. After a work we went in a restaurant in Sa 
Rapita (the small town nearby) to celebrate developer's day.</p> 
<h6 style="text-align: justify;">Day 5 - Caves | Lighthouse | Late talks by 
the pool</h6> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-315" 
alt="the team" src="assets/the-team.jpg" width="300" height="300" 
/>](http://files.bebetterleader.com/media/the-team.jpg)Saturday! This day was 
dedicated for sightseeing only. We've traveled Southeast to visit caves del 
Drac first, and then headed to North to drive some serpentines and walk on the 
edge of rocky mountains in Cap de Formentor. On our way home we stopped for an 
hour in Alcudia for late lunch or early dinner - delicious food, good mood. 
Not much of a work, but lots of teambuilding.</p> 
<h6 style="text-align: justify;">Day 6 - Morning coffee in Soller | Beautiful 
views | Even more serpentines</h6> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another day off. From the early morning (9 am) 
we took off for more sightseeing. Starting with a beautiful small old town - 
Soller. We spent there an hour browsing narrow streets of old town, then had a 
coffee with croissants from the local bakery and headed to  Sa Calobra very 
nice beach. After 35 km of serpentines we finally reached it. It was beautiful 
beach, paradise really worth going that way. We had to return till 6 pm - 
another basketball game by Lithuanian team, another one we won. Happy with 
lots of impressions form Today's sightseeing, with positive emotions from good 
game by Lithuanians, but a bit tired we chatted for a couple of hours by the 
pool and got to sleep happily exhausted.</p>
